<h2>PREFACE</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> present volume is an effort to trace the reform
movement in education from Vives, Bacon, and Ratke
to Comenius, who gave the movement its most significant
force and direction; and from him to the later
reformers,—Francke, Rousseau, Basedow, Pestalozzi,
Fröbel, and Herbart. A variety of ideas, interests,
and adaptations, all distinctly modern, are represented
in the life-creeds of these reformers; and, in the
absence of a more satisfactory term, the progressive
movement which they represent has been styled realism,—sometimes
called the “new education.”</p>

<p>It has been well said that “the dead hand of spiritual
ancestry lays no more sacred duty on posterity
than that of realizing under happier circumstances
ideas which the stress of age or the shortness of life
has deprived of their accomplishment.” Many of the
reforms represented by the realists occupy no inconsiderable
place in the platforms of modern practitioners
of education; and in the belief that a history
of the movement might contribute toward the ultimate
reforms which realism represents, it has seemed
expedient to focus such a survey on the life and
teachings of the strongest personality and chief exponent
of the movement.</p>

<p>The condition of education in Europe during the
sixteenth century is briefly told in the opening chap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>ter;
following are given the traces of the educational
development of Comenius in the writings of Vives,
Bacon, and Ratke; three chapters are devoted to the
life of Comenius and the reforms in which he actively
participated; an exposition of his educational writings
has three chapters; a chapter is given to the influence
of Comenius on Francke, Rousseau, Pestalozzi, and
other modern reformers; and the closing chapter
sums up his permanent influence. The volume has
two appendices,—one giving tables of dates relating
to the life and writings of Comenius, and the other
a select annotated bibliography.</p>

<p>In the exposition of the writings of Comenius, the
author has made liberal use of English and German
translations from Latin and Czech originals. In the
case of the <i>Great didactic</i>, the scholarly translation by
Mr. Keatinge has, in the main, been followed. Free
translations of portions of this work had been made
by the author before the appearance of Mr. Keatinge’s
book; and in some instances these have been
retained. As regards the account of Comenius’ views
on the earliest education of the child, the author’s
edition of the <i>School of infancy</i> has been followed;
and in the discussion of reforms in language teaching,
he is indebted to Mr. Bardeen’s edition of the <i>Orbis
pictus</i>, and to Dr. William T. Harris for the use of
the handsome Elzevir edition of the <i>Janua</i>, which is
the property of the Bureau of Education.</p>

<small>EUROPEAN EDUCATION IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY</small></h2></div>

the sixteenth century to the humanistic ideal—Study of Latin
eloquence—Style the chief aim—Neglect of the mother-tongue—Views

realism.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">“Education in Europe,”</span> says Oscar Browning,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>
“has passed through three phases, which may conveniently
be called humanism, realism, and naturalism.
The first is grounded upon the study of language, and
especially of the two dead languages, Greek and Latin.
The second is based upon the study of things instead
of words, the education of the mind through the eye
and the hand. Closely connected with this is the
study of those things which may be of direct influence
upon and direct importance to life. The third is
not in the first instance study at all. It is an attempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
to build up the whole nature of man,—to educate first
his body, then his character, and lastly his mind.”</p>

<p>The sixteenth century was wedded to the humanistic
ideal of education. Without regard for the
diversity of avocations, classical culture was held to
be the safest and best training for the manifold duties
of life. Aristotle’s <i>Politics</i> was considered the wisest
utterance on the direction of affairs of state; Cæsar’s
<i>Commentaries</i> the safest guides to military eminence;
the practical Stoicism of the Latin authors the most
infallible basis for ethics and the regulation of conduct;
and as for agriculture, had not Virgil written
a treatise on that subject? It was clear in the minds
of the sixteenth-century humanists that classical culture
furnished the best preparation, alike for theologians
and artisans.</p>

<p>To accomplish this purpose, as soon as the child
was considered sufficiently matured for linguistic discipline,
and this varied from the sixth to the ninth
years, he was initiated into the mysteries of Latin
eloquence. His preliminary training consisted in a
verbal study of the Latin grammar for purposes of
precision in speech and successful imitation; but, as
the grammar was printed in Latin, with its hundreds
of incomprehensible rules and exceptions, all of which
had to be “learned by heart,” the way of the young
learner was, indeed, a thorny one. True, the classical
authors were later read, but chiefly for the purpose
of gleaning from them choice phrases to be used in
the construction of Latin sentences, or for purposes
of disputations in dialectics. Logic and history were
given most subordinate places in the course of study,
the former merely that it might give greater precision<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
in writing and speaking, and the latter that it might
furnish illustrations in rhetorical exercises.</p>

<p>This conception of education was almost universally
held in the sixteenth century, by Protestants like
Trotzendorf and Sturm, as well as by Catholics like
Aquaviva and the members of the Society of Jesus.
Nor was it confined to elementary and secondary
education; for, as Professor Paulsen<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> has shown, the
conquest of European universities by the humanists
was complete by the second decade of the sixteenth
century. The statutes of most of the universities at
this time make the speaking of the Latin compulsory.
That at Ingolstadt reads: “A master in a bursary
shall induce to the continual use of Latin by verbal
exhortations and by his own example; and shall also
appoint those who shall mark such as speak the vulgar
tongue and shall receive from them an irremissible
penalty.” Again: “That the students in their academical
exercises may learn by the habit of speaking
Latin to speak and express themselves better, the
faculty ordains that no person placed by the faculty
upon a common or other bursary shall dare to speak
German. Any one heard by one of the overseers to
speak German shall pay one kreutzer.” There grew
out of this prohibition a widespread system of spying.
The spies reported to the university authorities on
such students (<i>vulgarisantes</i> they were called) who
persisted in speaking in the mother-tongue. In spite,
however, of statutes, spies, fines, and floggings, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
boys in the sixteenth century spoke little Latin when
they were alone by themselves. Cordier,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> writing in
1530, says, “Our boys always chatter French with
their companions; or if they try to talk Latin, cannot
keep it up.”</p>

<p>The old ecclesiastical Latin of the Middle Ages had
been superseded by the classical Latin of the Roman
poets, and all the energies of the educational institutions
were thrown into the acquisition and practice of
Latin eloquence. The classics were read for the
phrases that might be culled for use in the construction
of Latin sentences; these, with disputations,
declamations, and Latin plays, were the order of the
century. Since education consisted in the acquisition
of a graceful and elegant style, the young learner,
from the first, applied himself to the grammatical
study of Latin authors, regarding solely the language
of the classics, and taking subject-matter into account
only when this was necessary to understand the words.</p>

<p>There was no study of the mother-tongue preliminary
to the study of the classics. Children began at
once the study of the Latin grammar, and they had to
write Latin verses before they had been exercised in
compositions, in the vernacular, or, for that matter,
before they had been trained to express their thoughts
in Latin prose. And still more remarkable, as Oscar
Browning points out, “the Latin taught was not the
masculine language of Lucretius and Cæsar, but the
ornate and artificial diction of Horace and Virgil, and,
above all, of Cicero.” “There is no doubt,” he adds,
“that narrow and faulty as it was, it gave a good edu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>cation
so long as people believed in it. To know
Horace and Virgil by heart became the first duty of
the scholar. Speeches in Parliament were considered
incomplete if they did not contain at least one Latin
quotation. A false quantity was held to be a greater
crime than a slip in logical argument. Cicero not
only influenced the education of English statesmen,
but had no inconsiderable effect on their conduct.”</p>

<p>The humanist educators of the sixteenth century
not only neglected the study of the mother-tongue—they
proscribed it. The <i>Ratio</i><a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> of the Jesuits forbids
its use except on holidays, and Sturm at Strasburg
abbreviated the recreation periods of his pupils because
of risks of speaking in the mother-tongue on the playground.
And all this proscription of the vernacular
that students might acquire eloquence in a foreign
tongue. Well does Raumer<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> ask, “Why did they
continue, like a second Sisyphus, their fruitless
endeavors to metamorphose German into Roman
youths, and to impart to them, in defiance of the
laws of human nature, another tongue?”</p>

<p>They were themselves deceived in assuming that
they could call to life the ancient culture of Rome
and Greece. Indeed, they believed that they had discovered
ways of training which would develop scholars
capable of producing Latin works equal to the masterpieces
that they had studied in their schools. John
Sturm, one of the most ardent of the humanists, said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
“The Romans had two advantages over us; the one
consisted in learning Latin without going to school,
and the other in frequently seeing Latin comedies and
tragedies acted, and in hearing Latin orators speak.
Could we recall these advantages in our schools, why
could we not, by persevering diligence, gain what they
possessed by accident and habit—namely, the power
of speaking Latin to perfection? I hope to see the
men of the present age, in their writing and speaking,
not merely followers of the old masters, but equal to
those who flourished in the noblest age of Athens and
Rome.” But how misguided and mistaken!</p>

<p>Not only did Latin monopolize the curriculum of
the sixteenth-century school, but the study was primarily
philological, for grammatical structure, and
only secondarily for the content of the literature, for
a correct understanding of the author. As a matter of
fact, the method of study was such as to make intelligent
comprehension of the author’s thought next to impossible,
since the humanists simply culled out phrases
which might be imitated and used in the exercises of
style. Raumer says of this kind of teaching: “The
author was not an end, but only a means to an end—the
cultivation of deified Roman eloquence in boys.
And why? Precisely as the peacock was used by the
jackdaw. They borrowed the author’s words and
phrases, grouped them together, and learned them by
heart, in order subsequently to apply them in speech
or writing. Borrow is too feeble an expression; for
the jackdaw designed not merely to borrow the peacock’s
feathers, but to represent them as his own.
The doctrine of imitation, as set forth by Sturm and
the others, was, after all, a mere jackdaw theory.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
The pupil was taught how, by a slight alteration, to
disguise phrases from Cicero, and then to use them
in writing or speech, exactly as if they were his own
productions, so adroitly smuggling them in that the
readers or hearers might not suspect from whence they
were taken. Says Sturm: ‘When the teacher gives
out themes for composition, he should draw attention
to those points where imitation is desirable, and show
how similarity may be concealed by a superadded
variation.’ Again: ‘We must, in the first place, take
care that the similarity shall not be manifest. Its
concealment may be accomplished in three ways—by
adding, by taking away, and by alteration.’”</p>

<p>In this mad race for Latin eloquence, the sixteenth-century
humanists became more and more circumscribed
in the choice of authors. Sturm, for example,
placed Cicero at the head of the list, because of the
faultless models of his eloquence. The Jesuits likewise
held Cicero in high esteem. Said one of their
writers, “Style should be drawn almost exclusively
from Cicero, although the most approved of the historians
need not on that account be overlooked.” Again:
“The pattern we should follow in style is comprehended
in the words of the rule, ‘imitate Cicero.’ As
in the study of theology we follow the divine Thomas
Aquinas, and in philosophy Aristotle, so in the
humanities Cicero must be regarded as our peculiar
and preëminent leader. For he has been crowned by
the palm of superior praise by the common consent of
the world. But some, misguided by a wilful and
self-formed taste, have gone astray, preferring a style
totally different from that of Cicero; such an erratic
course is quite at variance with the genius of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
institutions and hostile to the spirit of prompt obedience.”</p>

<p>This servile devotion to Cicero, it should be recalled,
was a marked departure from the more varied and
richer curricula of the fifteenth-century humanists,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>
when men of the stamp of Vittorino da Feltre, Leonardo
Bruni, Vergarius, Sylvius, and Guarino were
the standard-bearers of humanism. Many causes had
conspired to bring about this decadence; and perhaps
the most fundamental cause was the senseless worship
of forms of expression. The later humanists worshipped
the <i>forms</i> of thought. “Beauty of expression,”
says Professor Laurie,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> “was regarded as inseparable
from truth and elevation of thought. The movement
soon shared the fate of all enthusiasms. The new
form was worshipped, and to it the spirit and substance
were subordinated. Style became the supreme
object of the educated classes, and successful imitation,
and thereafter laborious criticism, became marks
of the highest culture.”</p>

<p>This use of the classics as instruments in grammatical
drill and vehicles of communication had become
well-nigh universal by the middle of the sixteenth
century. Erasmus, himself one of the most ardent
advocates of classical learning, perceived apparently
the narrowing tendencies of humanistic training, and
urged that students be taught to know many things
besides Latin and Greek in order that they might the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
better comprehend the classics. He recommended the
addition of geography, arithmetic, and natural science
to the school course.</p>

<p>And Melanchthon, with all his enthusiasm for classical
learning, thought the humanities insufficient to
satisfy all the needs of culture. He advised the
incorporation of physics, mathematics, and astronomy
into the curriculum. “Although the nature of things
cannot be absolutely known, nor the marvellous works
of God traced to their original, until, in the future
life, we shall listen to the eternal counsel of the
Father,” he writes, “nevertheless, even amid this our
present darkness, every gleam and every hint of harmony
of this fair creation forms a step toward the
knowledge of God and toward virtue, whereby we ourselves
shall also learn to love and maintain order and
moderation in all our acts. Since it is evident that
men are endowed by their Creator with faculties fitted
for the contemplation of nature, they must, of necessity,
take delight in investigating the elements, the
laws, the qualities, and the forces of the various bodies
by which they are surrounded.”</p>

<p>As has already been shown, however, the humanists
took little interest in the study of subjects not discussed
by classical authors. Absorbed in a world of books,
as Mr. Quick<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> suggests, they overlooked the world of
nature. Galileo had in vain tried to persuade them
to look through his telescope, but they held that truth
could not be discovered by any such contrivances—that
it could be arrived at only by the comparison of
manuscripts. “No wonder,” remarks Mr. Quick,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
“that they had so little sympathy with children, and
did not know how to teach them.”</p>

<p>Fortunately for the history of education, there were
critics in the sixteenth century who did not conform
to the dogma of linguistic discipline, and who called
attention to the need of educational reform. Whatever
the merits of the classical languages, protested
these critics, they must derive their value ultimately
from the rank they take as literature. The protest of
Rabelais early in the century was not only one of the
first but one of the most effective charges against contemporary
practices. In his famous satire he intrusted
the young giant Gargantua to the care and training of
the humanist educator Tubal Holofernes, who spent
five years and a quarter in teaching him to say his
A B C’s backward; thirteen years on Donatus’ Latin
grammar and the composition of Latin verses and sentences;
thirty-four years more in the study of Latin
eloquence, after which the schoolmaster dies, when, as
Rabelais concluded, Gargantua had grown more ignorant,
heavy, and loutish. “In this confused and
ribald allegory,” says Mr. James P. Munroe,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> “Rabelais
led the way out of ancient superstition into modern
science. More than this, he taught in it that the
study of Nature, observation of her laws, imitation of
her methods, must be at the root of every true system
of education. He showed that the Nature spirit is the
true spirit of good teaching. Ever since his day civilized
mankind has been trying to learn this lesson of
his and to apply it in the schools. For three centuries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
the leaders in education, under his direct inspiration,
have been slowly and painfully transforming the false
pedagogy of the cloister into the true pedagogy of
out-of-doors. Writers and teachers, schools and universities,
have been engaged in a halting and irregular
struggle to transfer education from a metaphysical to
a physical basis, to lead it away from the habit of
deductive speculation into one of inductive research.
This transfer Rabelais made boldly and at once. He
did not, of course, elaborate the educational ideal of
to-day, but he plainly marked out the lines upon which
that ideal is framed. He taught truth and simplicity,
he ridiculed hypocrisy and formalism, he denounced
the worship of words, he demanded the study of things,
he showed the beauty of intellectual health, of moral
discipline, of real piety. Best of all, he enunciated
the supreme principle of Nature, which is <i>ordered
freedom</i>.”</p>

<p>Montaigne,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> also, in France, was equally severe in
his criticisms on the humanists. He denounced in no
uncertain terms the methods of introducing Latin to
beginners and the harsh and severe discipline so common
in the schools of Europe during the sixteenth
century. “Education ought to be carried on with a
severe sweetness,” he wrote, “quite contrary to the
practice of our pedants, who, instead of tempting and
alluring children to a study of language by apt and
gentle ways, do, in truth, present nothing before them
but rods and ferules, horror and cruelty. Away with
this violence! Away with this compulsion! There is
nothing which more completely dulls and degenerates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
the nature of a bright child.” Again: “Our schools
are houses of correction for imprisoned youths; and
children are made incorrigible by punishment. Visit
them when the children are getting their lessons, and
you will hear nothing but the outcries of boys under
execution and the thundering noises of their teachers,
drunk with fury. It is a pernicious way to tempt
young and timorous souls to love their books while
wearing a ferocious countenance and with a rod in
hand.”</p>

<p>Montaigne was equally convinced of the pedagogic
error of the humanists in regarding classical knowledge
as synonymous with wisdom. “We may become
learned from the learning of others,” he said, “but we
never become wise except by our own wisdom....
We are truly learned from knowing the present, not
from knowing the past any more than the future....
Yet we toil only to stuff the memory and leave the
conscience and understanding void. And like birds
abroad to forage for grain, bring it home in their beak,
without tasting it themselves, to feed their young, so
our pedants go picking knowledge here and there out
of several authors, and hold it at their tongue’s end,
only to spit it out and distribute it among their pupils.”</p>

<p>Roger Ascham,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> in the quaint preface of his <i>Scholemaster</i>,
also bears testimony against the harsh discipline
of the sixteenth century. During the great
plague in London, in 1563, Ascham and some friends
were dining at Windsor with Sir William Cecil.
While there he learned that many of the students at
Eton had run away because of the severe punishments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
administered at this famous public school. “Whereupon,”
says Ascham, “Sir William took occasion to
wish that some discretion were in many schoolmasters
in using correction than commonly there is, who
many times punish rather the weakness of nature than
the fault of the scholar, whereby many scholars that
might else prove well, be driven to hate learning
before they know what learning meaneth; and so are
made willing to forsake their book, and to be willing
to put to any other kind of living.” This incident led
to the composition of the <i>Scholemaster</i>, which was a
guide for “the bringing up of youth,” in which gentleness
rather than severity is recommended, and “a
ready way to the Latin tongue,” in which an honest
effort is made to simplify language teaching and adapt
it to the tastes and interests of young learners.</p>

<p>Richard Mulcaster,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> another Englishman and humanist
of the sixteenth century, questioned seriously the
wisdom of his associates and contemporaries in
their exclusion of the mother-tongue from the course
of study. In his <i>Elementarie</i> he asked: “Is it not
a marvellous bondage to become servants to one
tongue, for learning’s sake, the most part of our time,
with loss of most time, whereas we may have the very
same treasure in our own tongue with the gain of most
time? our own bearing the joyful title of our liberty
and freedom, the Latin tongue remembering us of our
thraldom and bondage. I love Rome, but London
better; I favor Italy, but England more: I honor the
Latin, but I worship the English.” Mr. Quick is
right in maintaining that “it would have been a vast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
gain to all Europe if Mulcaster had been followed
instead of Sturm. He was one of the earliest advocates
of the use of English instead of Latin, and good
reading and writing in English were to be secured
before Latin was begun.”</p>

<p>These were some of the voices raised against the
bookish classical learning of the sixteenth century;
but it remained for Vives, Bacon, and Ratke to convince
Europe of the insufficiency of the humanistic
ideal, and for Comenius, the evangelist of modern
pedagogy, to bring about the necessary reforms. The
part played by each in the transition from humanism
to realism, from classical learning and philology to
modern thought and the natural sciences, will be briefly
traced in the succeeding chapters of this work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Every</span> educational reformer owes much, in the way
of inspiration and suggestion, to his predecessors, and
of none is this more true than of John Amos Comenius.
Everywhere in his writings are to be found traces of
the movement he championed, in the writings of
Vives, Bacon, Ratke, Bateus, Campanella, and others.
As Professor Nicholas Murray Butler remarks: “From
Ratke he learned something of the way in which
language teaching, the whole curriculum of the time,
might be reformed; and from Bateus he derived both
the title and the plan of his <i>Janua</i>. Campanella suggested
to him the necessity of the direct interrogation
of nature if knowledge was to progress, and Vives
emphasized for him from the same point of view the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
defects of contemporary school practice. But it was
Bacon’s <i>Instauratio Magna</i> that opened his eyes to the
possibilities of our knowledge of nature and its place
in the educational scheme.”<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> This obligation to his
predecessors Comenius was the first to recognize.
And he recognized it often and specifically by his willing
tributes to the help received by him from Vives,
Bacon, Ratke, and others.</p>


<h3><i>Vives</i></h3>

<p>“Comenius received his first impulse as a sense-realist,”
says Raumer, “from the well-known Spanish
pedagogue John Lewis Vives, who had come out against
Aristotle and disputation in favor of a Christian mode
of philosophizing and the silent contemplation of
nature.” “It is better for the pupils to ask, to investigate,
than to be forever disputing with one another,”
said Vives. “Yet,” adds Comenius, “Vives understood
better where the fault was than what was the
remedy.” In the preface to the <i>Janua</i>, Comenius
quotes Vives among others as opposed to the current
methods of language teaching.</p>

<p>The Spanish educator was born a hundred years
before Comenius, of poor, but noble parentage. When
fifteen years old he was considered the most brilliant
pupil in the academy at Valencia. Two years later he
was matriculated in the University of Paris, where,
as his biographers tell us, he was surrounded by the
Dialecticians, whose theology was the most abstruse
and whose Latin was the most barbarous. This con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>dition
of affairs turned the young Spaniard’s thoughts
toward educational reform. He realized in Paris, as
he had not before, the uselessness of the empty disputations
which occupied so much time in the schools.</p>

<p>Three years were spent in study at Paris, after
which Vives travelled through portions of Spain and
France, and, in 1517, he settled with the Valdura
family in Bruges and married the daughter of his
host. Here he wrote his allegory <i>Christi triumphus</i>,
in which he holds up to ridicule the methods of teaching
in the University of Paris. A year later he was
installed in the University of Louvain as the instructor
of the young Cardinal de Croy. While here he wrote
a history of philosophy; made the acquaintance of
Erasmus; and opened correspondence with Thomas
More and other reformers.</p>

<p>In 1519 he visited Paris with Cardinal de Croy;
and, in spite of his late criticisms, he was cordially
received by the university, his scholarship and ability
now being recorded facts. Two years later De Croy
died without having made any provision for the support
of his tutor. Vives began at once a commentary
on St. Augustine; but his health giving way, he
returned to Bruges, where, in July, he had a personal
interview with Thomas More, Wolsey, and others, who
were in favor with Henry VIII of England. He
taught at Louvain during the winter semester of
1522–1523, after which, through the influence of the
English dignitaries already mentioned, he was called
to England.</p>

<p>In what capacity he went to England is hardly
known. Some say as the tutor of King Henry’s
daughter Mary; others as a lecturer in the University<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
of Oxford. Certain it is that he gave two lectures at
Oxford, which were attended by the king and queen,
and that he received the honorary degree of D.C.L.,
in 1523. In 1526 appeared his treatise on the care of
the poor, which he dedicated to the municipal council
of Bruges. It was one of the first scientific treatments
of pauperism. He maintained that it was incumbent
upon State, and not upon the Church to care for the
poor. Buisson says of it, “Its suggestions are as
attractive as they are wise; and even to-day they
continue in full force.”</p>

<p>In 1528 he published his pedagogic classic on the
Christian education of women. The mother, says
Vives, like Cornelia, should regard her children as
her most precious jewels. She should nurse her own
children because of possible physical influences on the
child. The mother should instruct her girl in all that
pertains to the household; and early teach her to read.
She should relate to her stories, not empty fables, but
such as will instruct and edify her and teach her to
love virtue and hate vice. The mother should teach
her daughter that riches, power, praise, titles, and
beauty are vain and empty things; and that piety,
virtue, bravery, meekness, and culture are imperishable
virtues. Strong discipline in the home is urged.
Lax discipline, says Vives, makes a man bad, but it
makes a woman a criminal. Dolls should be banished
from the nursery because they encourage vanity and
love of dress. Boys and girls should not be instructed
together, not even during the earliest years of childhood.
But women require to be educated as well as
men. This work, which presented in stronger terms
than hitherto the claims of the education of women,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
was dedicated to Catherine of Aragon. It was widely
republished and had large influence.</p>

<p>For five years Vives had been a distinguished figure
at the court of Henry VIII, but with the king’s application
for divorce, in 1528, came a rupture of these
pleasant relations. In a letter to a friend he says:
“You must have heard of the troubles between the
king and the queen, as it is now talked of everywhere.
I have taken the side of the queen, whose cause has
seemed to me just, and have defended her by word and
pen. This offended his Majesty to such degree that I
was imprisoned for six weeks, and only released upon
condition that I would never appear in the palace
again. I then concluded it safest to return home [to
Bruges]; and, indeed, the queen advised me to in a
secret letter. Shortly after Cardinal Campeggio was
sent to Britain to judge the cause. The king was very
solicitous that the queen appoint counsel to defend
her side before Campeggio and Wolsey. She, therefore,
called me to her aid; but I told her plainly that
any defence before such a court was useless, and that
it would be much better to be condemned unheard,
than with the <i>appearance</i> of defence. The king sought
only to save appearances with his people, that the
queen might not appear to have been unjustly treated;
but he had little regard for the rest. At this the
queen was incensed that I did not obey her call instead
of following my own good judgment, which is worth
more to me than all the princes of the world together.
So it has come about that the king regards me as his
adversary, and the queen regards me as disobedient
and opinionated; and both of them have withdrawn
my pension.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span></p>

<p>His closing years were passed at Bruges with his
wife’s family; at Breda with the Duchess of Nassau,
a Spanish lady who had formerly been his pupil; and
at Paris, where he gave some courses of lectures. He
had struggled against a weak constitution all his life,
and after his return from England other diseases
developed. He died on May 6, 1540, in his forty-eighth
year, and was buried in the Church of St.
Donat at Bruges.</p>

<p>His most considerable contribution to the philosophy
of education appeared after his return from England.
It was entitled <i>De disciplinis</i>; was published in
three parts, in 1531; and was dedicated to the King of
Portugal. As Dr. Lange remarks, this work alone
entitles Vives to large consideration as an educational
reformer.</p>

<p>Vives justifies, in the introduction, the position he
assumes in regard to Aristotle; while he regards the
Greek as a great philosopher, he declares that the
world has gained in experience since Aristotle wrote,
and he sees no reason why his teachings should not be
set aside if found to be incorrect. He has no doubt
but that later generations will find theories better
adapted to their ends than those he himself advocates,
but he greets as a friend the one who shall point out
his errors.</p>

<p>In the first part he treats of the decline of the
sciences. The causes of this decline he considers twofold:
(1) Moral; and here he notes an unwillingness
to search for truth for truth’s sake. Pride is the root
of this evil. A student in the University of Paris had
remarked to him, “Sooner than not distinguish myself
by founding some new doctrine, I would defend one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
whose falsity I was convinced.” This moral weakness
he thought altogether inconsistent with the advancement
of the sciences. (2) Historical and material,
including as causes the migration of nations by which
existing orders of civilization have been annihilated;
the obscurity of ancient manuscripts, requiring more
time to decipher their meaning than it would take to
discover from nature their meaning; the ever increasing
use of commentaries in the study of originals, in
which the diverse opinions of the commentators lead
farther from the original sense; the practice of scholastic
disputation which is taught the pupils before
they know what they are disputing about; and the
practice of regarding teaching as a trade rather than
a profession, thus causing many bright minds to select
other vocations, and to bring to the work incompetent
and coarse minds.</p>

<p>The second part treats of the decline of grammar,
and the third part of the art of teaching, in which he
gives some most sane directions. Schools should be
located in the most healthy part of the community.
They should not be too near commercial centres; at
the same time, they should not be too distant from the
centre of population. As to teachers, they should
have good academic training; they should be skilled
in the art of imparting knowledge; and their morals
should be such as would furnish examples to their
pupils. Covetousness and ambition, above all things,
should be unknown to them. Teachers who have
ambition and reputation in their minds are thereby
unfitted for the work of teaching. On this account,
the state should fix the salaries, and the compensation
should be the wage of honest men. There should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
a school in every community. Before pupils should
be assigned tasks, teachers should ascertain their
mental capacities and characteristics. They should
also be privately tested four times a year; and when
children are found who possess no taste for study they
should be dismissed from the school. Corporal punishment
should seldom be applied, and never to such
a degree as to humiliate the pupils. Children should
be given plenty of play time; and hearty, romping
games are especially recommended. In the matter of
method, Vives heartily commends the inductive,—from
particulars to generals,—and he urges such a
grouping of studies that each new subject studied may
naturally grow out of the preceding lesson. While he
strongly advises the study of the natural sciences, he
is less enthusiastic here than Bacon, fearing, as
he admits, that a contemplation of nature may prove
dangerous to those not deeply grounded in faith.</p>

<p>But Vives was essentially a realist in his doctrines
of education; and when his views are compared with
those of Comenius, community of ideas is at once
apparent. Both would begin education in the home
and make the mother the first teacher. Both realized
the need of better organization and classification of
the schools. Both urged reforms in the matter of
language teaching. Both considered education a matter
of state concern, and urged pedagogical training
for teachers. Both presented the claims of science
and urged the coördination and correlation of the
different subjects of study. Both emphasized the value
of play and the need of physical training. Both advocated
education for all classes of both sexes, and both
exaggerated the need and importance of the religious
training of the child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span></p>


<h3><i>Bacon</i></h3>

<p>“Though there were many before Bacon, and especially
artists and craftsmen,” says Raumer, “who lived
in communion with nature, and who, in manifold ways,
transfigured and idealized her, and unveiled her glory;
and, though their sense for nature was so highly cultivated
that they attained to a practical understanding of
her ways, yet this understanding was at best merely
instinctive: for it led them to no scientific deductions
and yielded them no thoughtful and legitimate dominion
over her.”</p>

<p>The founder of modern realism was born in London
on the 22d of January in the year 1561. When sixteen
years of age he entered Trinity College, Cambridge,
where he studied under Dr. John Whitgift, a
noted professor of theology, and afterward archbishop
of Canterbury. He studied diligently the writings of
Aristotle, but was convinced of their inadequacy.
Writing of this period he says: “Amid men of sharp
and strong wits, and abundance of leisure, and small
variety of reading, their wits being shut up in the
cells of a few authors, chiefly Aristotle, their dictator,
as their persons are shut up in the cells of monasteries
and colleges; and who knowing little history, either
of nature or time, did out of no great quantity of
matter, and infinite agitation of wit, spin cobwebs of
learning, admirable for the fineness of the thread and
work, but of no substance or profit.”</p>

<p>The checkered career of Bacon is extraneous to his
writings and may be passed over in silence. As noted
in the first chapter, the educational institutions of the
sixteenth century concerned themselves wholly with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
the acquisition and display of Latin eloquence.
Grammar was studied with infinite labor and sorrow
for years that students might acquire correct forms of
speech; logic that they might express themselves with
precision; and a minimum of history was taught that
ancient records might furnish ornate illustrations in
speaking and writing.</p>

<p>Erasmus and Melanchthon had disputed this ideal
of culture, but it remained for Bacon to demolish this
idol of mediævalism. “Forsooth,” he says, “we suffer
the penalty of our first parents’ sin, and yet follow in
their footsteps. They desired to be like God, and we,
their posterity, would be so in a higher degree. For
we create worlds, direct and control nature, and, in
short, square all things by the measure of our own
folly, not by the plummet of divine wisdom, nor as we
find them in reality. I know not whether, for this
result we are forced to do violence to nature or to our
own intelligence the most; but it nevertheless remains
true, that we stamp the seal of our own image upon
the creatures and works of God, instead of carefully
searching for, and acknowledging, the seal of the
Creator manifest in them. Therefore have we lost,
the second time, and that deservedly, our empire over
the creatures, yea, when after and notwithstanding
the fall, there was left to us some title to dominion
over the unwilling creatures, so that they could be
subjected and controlled, even this we have lost, in
great part through our pride, in that we have desired
to be like God, and to follow the dictates of our own
reason alone. Now then, if there be any humility in
the presence of the Creator, if there be any reverence
for and exaltation of his handiwork, if there be any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
charity toward men, any desires to relieve the woes
and sufferings of humanity, any love for the light of
truth, and hatred toward the darkness of error,—I
would beseech men again and again, to dismiss altogether,
or at least for a moment to put away their
absurd and intractable theories, which give to assumptions
the dignity of hypotheses, dispense with experiment,
and turn them away from the works of God.
Let them with a teachable spirit approach the great
volume of creation, patiently decipher its secret characters,
and converse with its lofty truths; so shall
they leave behind the delusive echoes of prejudice, and
dwell within the perpetual outgoings of divine wisdom.
This is that speech and language whose lines
have gone out into all the earth, and no confusion of
tongues has ever befallen it. This language we should
all strive to understand, first condescending, like little
children, to master its alphabet.”</p>

<p>Instead of training children to interrogate nature
for themselves, and to interpret the answers to these
interrogations, instead of going straight to nature herself,
the schools are forever teaching what others
have thought and written on the subject. This procedure,
according to Bacon, not only displays lack of
pedagogic sense, but gives evidence of ignorance and
self-conceit, and inflicts the greatest injury on philosophy
and learning. Such methods of instruction, moreover,
tend to stifle and interrupt all inquiry. We must,
says Bacon, “come as new-born children, with open
and fresh minds, to the observation of nature. For
it is no less true in this human kingdom of knowledge
than in God’s kingdom of heaven, that no man shall
enter into it except as he becomes first as a little child.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span></p>

<p>Bacon’s notion, as summarized by Raumer, was that
“man must put himself again in direct, close, and
personal contact with nature, and no longer trust to
the confused, uncertain, and arbitrary accounts and
descriptions of her historians and would-be interpreters.
From a clear and correct observation and
perception of objects, their qualities, powers, etc.,
the investigator must proceed, step by step, till he
arrives at laws, and to that degree of insight that will
enable him to interpret the laws and to analyze the
processes of nature. To this end Bacon proffers to us
his new method—the method of induction. With
the aid of this method we attain to an insight into
the connection and natural relation of the laws of
matter, and thus, according to him, we are enabled
through this knowledge to make nature subservient to
our will.”</p>

<p>This was, according to Comenius, the true key to the
human intellect. But he laments that Bacon should
have given us the key and failed to unlock the door to
the treasure-house. But Bacon did more than formulate
the laws of scientific induction for pedagogic purposes:
he made possible the enrichment of the courses
of study by the addition of a wide range of school
studies. His thrusts at the Latin and Greek, as the
sole exponents of culture, were telling in their effect
and made possible the recognition of the vernacular
themes in Comenius’ day. “The wisdom of the
Greeks,” he says, “was rhetorical; it expended itself
upon words, and it had little to do with the search
after truth.” Speaking again of classical culture, he
says: “These older generations fell short of many of
our present knowledges; they know but a small part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
of the world, and but a brief period of history. We,
on the contrary, are acquainted with a far greater
extent of the world, besides having discovered a new
hemisphere, and we look back and survey long periods
of history.”</p>

<p>Bacon recognized great individual differences in the
mental capacities of children, and he urged that these
differences and special tastes be taken into account by
the teachers. He says: “The natural bent of the
individual minds should be so far encouraged that a
student who shall learn all that is required of him
may be allowed time in which to pursue a favorite
study. And, furthermore, it is worth while to consider,
and I think this point has not hitherto received
the attention which its importance demands, that there
are two distinct modes of training the mind to a free
and appropriate use of its faculties. The one begins
with the easiest, and so proceeds to the more difficult;
the other, at the outset, presses the pupil with the
more difficult tasks, and, after he has mastered these,
turns him to pleasanter and easier ones: for it is one
method to practise swimming with bladders, and
another to practise dancing with heavy shoes. It is
beyond all estimate how a judicious blending of these
two methods will profit both the mental and the bodily
powers. And so to select and assign topics of instruction
as to adapt them to the individual capabilities
of the pupils,—this, too, requires a special experience
and judgment. A close observation and an accurate
knowledge of the different natures of the pupils
are due from teachers to the parents of these pupils,
that they may choose an occupation in life for their
sons accordingly. And note further, that not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
does every one make more rapid progress in those
studies to which his nature inclines him, but, again,
that a natural disinclination, in whatever direction,
may be overcome by the help of special studies. For
instance, if a boy has a light, inattentive, inconstant
spirit, so that he is easily diverted, and his attention
cannot be readily fixed, he will find advantage in the
mathematics, in which a demonstration must be commenced
anew whenever the thought wanders even for
a moment.”</p>

<p>These citations will suggest parallels in the aims of
the two great reformers. Both sought to introduce
the student to nature at first hand. Both aimed to
reorganize the sciences into one great body of coördinated
knowledge. Both emphasized the value of the
inductive method in the development of subjects of
study. Bacon said: “A good method will solve all
problems. A cripple on the right path will beat a
racer on the wrong path.” Said Comenius: “The
secret of education lies in method.” Again: “There
is no difficulty in learning Latin: what we want is a
good method.”</p>


<h3><i>Ratke</i></h3>

<p>Although but little more than twenty years the senior
of Comenius, Ratke’s mental development was less
tardy, so that when the Moravian was a young collegian
at Herborn, Ratke was enjoying the full flush
of popularity as an educational reformer. Born at
Wilster in Holstein (Germany), in 1571, he trained in
the gymnasium at Hamburg, and later studied philosophy
at Rostock. Later he travelled in England and
Holland; studied Hebrew and Arabic, and formulated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
the plan of education which made him famous as a
reformer. He attached great value to his plan and
expressed great unwillingness to divulge it without
adequate remuneration. He made known his contemplated
reforms at a diet of the German Empire, held
at Frankfort on the 12th of May, 1612. They were
threefold: (1) To teach Latin, Greek, or Hebrew, or
any other language, to young or old in a very short
time; (2) to establish schools in which the arts and
sciences should be taught and extended; (3) to introduce
a uniform speech throughout the empire, and, at
the same time, uniform government and religion. He
proposed to follow the order and course of nature, and
teach first the mother-tongue, after this Hebrew and
Greek, as being the tongues of the original text of the
Bible, and, lastly, Latin.</p>

<p>Through the influence of the princes (and more especially
by the encouragement of the Duchess Dorothea
of Weimar), the plans of Ratke were submitted to a
commission selected from the faculties of the universities
at Jena and Giessen,—Professors Grawer,
Brendel, Walther, and Wolf representing Jena and
Professors Helwig and Jung, Giessen. The report
was favorable to Ratke. Professor Helwig, who was
one of the best linguists of his day, was the spokesman
for Giessen, and he accepted Ratke’s views with
great enthusiasm. “By diligent reflection and long
practice,” he says, “Ratke has discovered a valuable
method by which good arts and languages can be
taught and studied more easily, quickly, and correctly
than has been usual in the schools. Ratke’s method
is more practicable in the arts than in the sciences,
since arts and sciences are by their nature consistent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
with themselves, while the languages, on the contrary,
by long use have acquired many inaccuracies.”</p>

<p>Professor Helwig commends especially the methodology
in Ratke’s plan, and urges that we must consider
not only the knowledge to be imparted, but as
well the method of imparting knowledge. He says:
“Nature does much, it is true, but when art assists
her, her work is much more certain and complete.
Therefore it is necessary that there should be an especial
art to which any one who desires to teach can
adhere, so that he shall not teach by mere opinion and
guess, nor by native instinct alone, but by the rules of
his art; just as he who would speak correctly by the
rules of grammar, and he who would sing correctly by
the rules of music. This art of teaching, like the art
of logic, applies to all languages, arts, and sciences.
It discusses among other things how to distinguish
among minds and gifts, so that the quicker may not
be delayed, and that, on the contrary, those who are
by nature not so quick may not remain behind; how
and in what order to arrange the exercises; how to
assist the understanding; how to strengthen the
memory; how to sharpen the intellect without violence
and after the true course of nature. This art of
teaching, no less than other arts, has its fixed laws
and rules, founded not only upon the nature and
understanding of man, but upon the peculiarities of
languages, arts, and sciences; and it admits of no ways
of teaching which are not deduced from sure grounds
and founded upon proof.” The Jena professors were
no less favorable with regard to this new art of
teaching.</p>

<p>The influence of this report on the fame of Ratke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
was far-reaching. The following year (1614) he was
invited to Augsburg to reform the schools of that city.
This invitation was the outgrowth of a study of his
plan by David Höschel, the principal of St. Anne’s
School, and two other teachers appointed by the city
to accompany him to Frankfort and aid him in the
investigation. They reported that Ratke had so far
explained his method to them that they were satisfied
and pleased with it; and the invitation to Ratke
promptly followed. Beyond a few monographs by the
Augsburg disciples, based on his method, and inspired
doubtless by his sojourn there, we are altogether without
evidence of the success or failure of the reforms
at Augsburg.</p>

<p>Early in 1616, Prince Ludwig of Anhalt-Gotha
yielded to the persuasions of his sister, the Duchess
Dorothea of Weimar, and invited Ratke to Gotha to
organize the schools there in accordance with his
views. He engaged to organize and supervise the
schools and to instruct and train the teachers, but he
bound the prince to exact from each teacher a promise
not to divulge his method to any one.</p>

<p>A printing-office was established at Gotha to supply
the books required by the new order. Fonts of type
in six languages were imported from Holland, and
four compositors and two pressmen were brought from
Rostock and Jena. The people of Gotha were required
by the prince to send their children to the schools
organized by Ratke. Two hundred and thirty-one
boys and two hundred and two girls were enrolled.</p>

<p>The school was graded into six classes. The mother-tongue
was taught in the lowest classes; Latin was
begun in the fourth, and Greek in the sixth. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
required that the teacher in the lowest class should be
a man of kind manners, and that he need know no
language but the German. This scandalized the whole
German nation. A schoolmaster ignorant of Latin!
Critics appeared from the first with the most cogent
reasons for distrusting the “new methods.” But
Ratke had the confidence of the prince, and all went
merrily for a time. The instruction was simplified;
and, besides the mother-tongue, arithmetic, singing,
and religion were taught.</p>

<p>But he encountered numerous obstacles at Gotha:
the teachers of the town, it would appear, did not
fully share his views; the town adhered to the
Reformed Church and Ratke was a Lutheran,—a fact
which caused no end of trouble; and the prince was
not altogether satisfied with the fulfilment of Ratke’s
promises of reform. The pastor of the Reformed
Church of Gotha preferred formal charges of heterodoxy
against him, and maintained, besides, that Ratke
made too little provision for the study of music and
the catechism; that too much time was given to
recreation; that the discipline was altogether too
mild; and that the children were permitted to pass
from one study to another too rapidly. Singular
charges, these! And the more singular when one
recalls the long hours and the harsh discipline of the
seventeenth century.</p>

<p>The opposition was strong, and at the end of eighteen
months the Gotha experiment was brought to an
abrupt close. Ratke was not only dismissed, but was
imprisoned on the charge that he “had claimed and
promised more than he knew that he could bring to
pass.” After spending the best of a year in prison,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
he signed a declaration in which he assented to the
charges. Then the prince released him. He went to
Magdeburg, where he was well received by the school
authorities; but the ecclesiastical dignitaries of the
city were soon at war with him, and he moved on to
Rudolstadt, where he was cordially received by the
Princess Anna Sophia, wife of Prince Gunther of
Swarzburg-Rudolstadt.</p>

<p>Subsequently Oxenstiern, the chancellor of Sweden,
sought his services in the reformation of the Swedish
schools; but instead of the requested interview, he
sent the chancellor a thick quarto. “I accomplished
this wearisome labor,” says Oxenstiern; “and after I
had read the whole book through, I found that he had
not ill displayed the faults of the schools, but his
remedies did not seem to me adequate.” Ratke died
shortly afterward at the age of sixty-four years.</p>

<p>Ratke’s contribution to education was chiefly in the
matter of methodology. His leading principles were:
(1) In everything we should follow the order of nature.
There is a certain natural sequence along which the
human intelligence moves in the acquisition of knowledge.
This sequence must be studied, and instruction
must be based on a knowledge of it. (2) One thing
at a time. Each subject of study should be orderly
developed and thoroughly dealt with before proceeding
to the next. (3) There should be frequent repetition.
It is astonishing what may be accomplished by the
frequent repetition of one thing. (4) Everything first
in the mother-tongue. The first thinking should
always be in the vernacular. Whatever the vocation,
the pupil should learn to express himself in the
mother-tongue. After the mother-tongue has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
mastered, the other languages may be studied.
(5) Everything without compulsion. Children cannot
be whipped into learning or wishing to learn; by
compulsion and blows they are so disgusted with their
studies that study becomes hateful to them. Moreover,
it is contrary to nature to flog children for not
remembering what has been taught them. If they
had been properly taught they would have remembered,
and blows would have been unnecessary. Children
should be taught to love and reverence—not to
fear their teachers. (6) Nothing should be learned by
rote. Learning by heart weakens the understanding.
If a subject has been well developed, and has been
impressed upon the mind by frequent repetition, the
memory of it will follow without any pains. Frequent
hours of recreation are advised; in fact, no two
lessons should come immediately together. (7) A definite
method (and a uniform method) for all studies.
In the languages, arts, and sciences, there must be a
conformity in the methods of teaching, text-books
used, and precepts given. The German grammar, for
instance, must agree with the Hebrew and the Greek
as far as the idioms of the language will permit.
(8) The thing itself should first be studied, and then
whatever explains it. Study first the literature of a
language and then its grammar. A basis of material
must first be laid in the mind before rules can be
applied. He admits that many of the grammars furnish
examples with the rules; but these examples
“come together from all sorts of authors, like mixed
fodder in a manger.” (9) Everything must be learned
by experience and examination. Nothing is to be
taken on authority. It will be recalled that Ratke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
visited England after the completion of his studies at
Rostock; and it is altogether likely that while there
he became a convert to induction and the philosophy
of Bacon.</p>

<p>In most particulars Ratke and Comenius were in
harmony. Both urged that the study of things should
precede or be united with the study of words; that
knowledge should be communicated through appeals
to the senses; that all linguistic study should begin
with the mother-tongue; that methods of teaching
should be in accordance with the laws of nature; and
that progress in studies should be based not on
compulsion, but on the interest aroused in the pupils.</p>


<h3><i>Campanella, Andreæ, and Bateus</i></h3>

<p>Comenius derived many of his philosophic concepts
from the Dominican reformer, Thomas Campanella,
whose writings influenced him powerfully, at least
during his student years at Herborn and Heidelberg.
The writings of Campanella convinced him of the
unwisdom of the study of nature from the works of
Aristotle. Books, Campanella had declared, are but
dead copies of life, and are full of error and deception.
We must ourselves explore nature and write
down our own thoughts, the living mirror which shows
the reflection of God’s countenance. These protests
against scholasticism found a responsive chord in the
thoughts of the young Comenius.</p>

<p>In the preface to the <i>Prodromus</i> Comenius is unreserved
in his expression of obligations to his predecessors.
“Who, indeed, should have the first place,”
he says, “but John Valentine Andreæ, a man of nimble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
and clear brain.” The court preacher of Stuttgart had
strongly impressed Comenius by his deep love for
Christian ideals and his warm enthusiasm for their
realization in practical life, as well as by his humorous
polemics against the dead scholasticism of his day.
Comenius incorporates in his <i>Great didactic</i> a brief by
Andreæ on “the use of the art of teaching,” in which
he maintains (1) that parents up to this time have
been uncertain how much to expect from their children;
(2) that schoolmasters, the greater number of
whom have been ignorant of their art, have exhausted
their energies and worn themselves out in their efforts
to fulfil their duty; (3) that students should master
the sciences without difficulty, tedium, or blows, as if
in sport and in merriment; (4) that schools should
become places of amusement, houses of delight and
attraction, and the work so adjusted that students of
whatever capacity might attain a high standard of
development; (5) that states should exist for the
development of the young; (6) that schools should be
so efficient that the Church may never lack learned
doctors, and the learned doctors lack suitable hearers;
and (7) that the schools may be so reformed that they
may give a more exact and universal culture of the
intellect, and that Christian youths may be more fervently
stirred up to vigor of mind and love of heavenly
things. “Let none, therefore,” says Andreæ, “withdraw
his thoughts, desires, strength, and resources
from such a sacred undertaking. It is inglorious to
despair of progress and wrong to despise the counsel of
others.”</p>

<p>The obligation of Comenius to William Bateus, the
Irish Jesuit, was not great, although he makes free<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
acknowledgment of the same in the <i>Janua</i>. Indeed,
the plan of the <i>Janua</i> was well formulated before he
knew of the existence of the Jesuit father’s book.
He made known the plan of his <i>Janua</i> to some friends,
who told him that Bateus had already published a
similar work. He was not content until he had procured
a copy of the book. “The idea,” says Comenius,
“was better than the execution. Nevertheless, as he
was the prime inventor, I thankfully acknowledge it,
nor will I upbraid him for those errors he has committed.”
This willing recognition of his obligation
to a wide range of educational writers is proof of the
declaration he often made, “I care not whether I act
the part of teacher or learner.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

<small>BOYHOOD AND EARLY LIFE OF COMENIUS: 1592–1628</small></h2></div>

Latin schools of his day—Enters the college at Herborn—Studies
theology and philosophy—Inspired by the teachings of Alsted—Makes

<p><span class="smcap">Many</span> of the facts concerning the early life of John
Amos Comenius are shrouded in obscurity. It is
certain, however, that he was born in the village of
Nivnitz in Moravia (now a province of Austria) on
the 28th day of March, in the year 1592. Nivnitz
then, as now, was little more than a country market
town and settled quite largely by members of the
religious organization known as Moravian Brethren.
The father and mother of Comenius, Martin and Anna
Komensky, were influential members of the brotherhood,
who had settled here some years previous with
other followers of John Hus, the Bohemian reformer
and martyr. The tradition that Martin Komensky
was a miller by trade does not seem to be well authenticated.
Besides John Amos, three daughters were
born to Martin and Anna Komensky,—Ludmilla,
Susanna, and Margaret,—but the three girls died in
early childhood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span></p>

<p>Martin Komensky died in 1604,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> and his wife survived
him less than a year. Left an orphan at the
early age of twelve years, Comenius was intrusted to
the care and training of an improvident aunt, who
soon made way with his inheritance. In this, as
in the neglect of his school training, the incompetence
of the foster parent is clearly apparent. For
something more than four years the lad attended
the village school at Strasnitz. But, as he himself
tells us, the curriculum was narrow and the teaching
poor. While here Comenius formed the acquaintance
of a schoolfellow named Nicholas Drabik, through
whose prophetic visions he was so ignominiously led
astray in his later life, and so bitterly reproached by
his contemporaries. “It was a strange irony of fate,”
remarks Mr. Keatinge, “that a wanderer like
Comenius, when only eleven years old and in his
native land, should commence the intimacy that was
to embitter his old age in Amsterdam.” But, as Benham
notes, the fact that the matter was so soon forgotten
shows that the character of Comenius received
no indelible stain by the unfortunate alliance, even
though he excited the ridicule and disrespect, and
even the contempt, of his contemporaries.</p>

<p>At the advanced age of sixteen years, he was initiated
into the mysteries of classical learning in the
Latin school at Prerau, where he studied for two
years. A fairly accurate notion of his studies during
this period may be gained from a glance at the course
of study in a contemporary Latin school herewith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
reproduced in translation from the Bohemian.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> The
schedule of hours in the second grade of this school
was as follows: In the morning, during the first hour,
repetition of grammar lesson from memory and explanation
of the next day’s grammar lesson. During the
second hour, the dialogues of Castalio; and the third
hour, the recitation of Castalio’s dialogues in the
Bohemian, and the grammatical analysis of the words
and conversation of the lesson. In the afternoon,
during the first hour, writing and singing; the second
hour, explanation of the writings of Cicero according
to Sturm’s edition, and grammatical analysis; and the
third hour, exercises in words and sayings. This was
the programme for Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and
Saturdays. On Wednesdays there was but one lesson
in the morning and one in the afternoon. In the
morning the catechism was recited; in addition, imitative
exercises for the formation of style. In the
afternoon, the writing of short words and a recapitulation
of the week’s lessons.</p>

<p>The programme for the third grade was as follows:
In the forenoon of Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays,
and Fridays:—</p>

<p><i>First hour.</i>—Repetition of Latin rules in the
mother-tongue.</p>

<p><i>Second hour.</i>—Exposition of the conversations of
John Lewis Vives.</p>

<p><i>Third hour.</i>—Repetition of the above, and Bohemian
exercises from the text.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of the same days, first hour, writing
and singing; second hour, Greek grammar and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
collected writings of John Sturm; and third hour,
exposition of Greek proverbs from the New Testament,
together with grammatical analysis of the same.
This class had for its forenoon lesson on Wednesdays
the catechism and exercises in the Bohemian, and in
the afternoon singing and writing. <i>In the summer the
more industrious pupils were excused from the lessons on
Wednesday afternoons.</i></p>

<p>One period on Saturday was devoted to a weekly
review; and on Sunday morning a chapter was read
from the New Testament, the same explained in Greek
(to all grades above the second), and all the students
attended church. In the afternoon there was preaching
again and more reading from the New Testament.</p>

<p>Such we may suppose to have been the character of
his studies at Prerau during the two years from 1608
to 1610. Because of his maturity, he appreciated
most keenly the faults of current humanistic methods
of teaching. As one of his biographers remarks:
“The defects of this early education were the seeds
from which sprang the whole of his didactic efforts.
Considerably older than his school-fellows, he was able
to criticise the methods and speedily arrive at the conclusion
that the lack of progress was due more to the
inefficiency of the teachers than to the idleness of
their pupils. From this time onward, he began to
devise new methods of class instruction and better
schemes of study. From the vivid memory of the horrors
through which he had passed, of the thousand and
one rules that had to be learned by rote before they
were understood, of the monotonous study of grammar,
only diversified by the maddening effort to translate
Latin authors without the assistance of suitable dic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>tionaries
or commentaries, sprang that intense sympathy
with beginners which characterizes his whole
life and gives practical worth to every precept that he
enunciated.”</p>

<p>After two years in the Latin school at Prerau, he
entered the college at Herborn on the 30th of March,
1611. The University of Prague was at this time in
the hands of the Utraquists, whose unfriendly attitude
toward the Moravian Brethren led to the selection of
a German university for his higher course of instruction.
He had determined to qualify for the ministry,
and the institution at Herborn at this time afforded
unusual opportunities for the study of theology.
Doubtless another factor in the selection of Herborn
was the fact that John Henry Alsted, one of the most
distinguished theological and philosophical professors
of the day, was lecturing there, and aspiring youths
of the temperament of Comenius naturally gravitated
toward this centre of fresh thought. Although but
four years older than Comenius, Alsted was the most
commanding figure in the academic circles of Europe
at this time. He had travelled extensively; had made
the acquaintance of most of the learned men in Europe
worth knowing; and had advocated views of education
which were new and startling.</p>

<p>For twenty-seven years Herborn had enjoyed unprecedented
academic prosperity. Opportunities for the
study of education were unexcelled; for, connected
with the college, there was a preparatory department
which served as a laboratory for the study of pedagogic
problems, in which, for example, the lower classes
were instructed in the mother-tongue—a procedure
that was regarded as ultra-heterodox at this time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span></p>

<p>Comenius was most helped by the instruction of the
distinguished theologian and philosopher, Professor
John Henry Alsted. The teachings of Alsted were
of a character calculated to deepen the convictions of
the young student from Moravia, for the Herborn professor
taught among other things—as is indicated by
his <i>Encyclopædia of the sciences</i>, published a few years
later—the following: (1) Not more than one thing
should be taught at a time; (2) not more than one
book should be used on one subject, and not more than
one subject should be taught on one day; (3) everything
should be taught through the medium of what is
more familiar; (4) all superfluity should be avoided;
(5) all study should be mapped out in fixed periods;
(6) all rules should be as short as possible; (7) everything
should be taught without severity, though discipline
must be maintained; (8) corporal punishment
should be reserved for moral offences, and never inflicted
for lack of industry; (9) authority should not
be allowed to prejudice the mind against the facts
gleaned from experience, nor should custom or preconceived
opinion prevail; (10) the construction of a new
language should first be explained in the vernacular;
(11) no language should be taught by means of grammar;
(12) grammatical terms should be the same in all
languages. “The teacher,” said Alsted, “should be
a skilled reader of character, so that he may be able
to classify the dispositions of his pupils. Unless he
pays great attention to differences of disposition, he
will but waste all the efforts he expends in teaching.”</p>

<p>Another professor of philosophy at Herborn at the
time was Heinrich Gutberleth, who was likewise
deeply interested in pedagogy and whose lectures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
seem to have influenced Comenius, with special reference
to his advocacy of the study of the physical
sciences. In theology he heard lectures by Piscator,
Hermannus, and Pasor. Since 1530 the schools of
Nassau had been marked by great improvement, and
this improvement was in no small measure due to the
intelligent interest of the professors of theology at
Herborn in the schools of the province. Hermannus,
with whom Comenius studied practical theology, was
especially active in school reform.</p>

<p>It was during his student life at Herborn that
Comenius became acquainted with Ratke’s plan of
instruction, then much discussed at university centres,
and especially at Jena, Giessen, and Herborn. However
much he may have been stimulated to educational
reform by his own belated classical training and by
the pedagogic character of the work at Herborn, the
writings of Ratke, as he himself tells us, played the
largest part in making him an educational reformer.
While at Herborn he gave special attention to the
Bohemian language, and planned a dictionary which
was never published.</p>

<p>Comenius left Herborn in the spring of 1613; and
after a few weeks’ sojourn at Amsterdam he repaired
to Heidelberg, where he matriculated as a student of
philosophy and theology on the 13th of June. Beyond
the fact that he purchased a manuscript of Copernicus,
and that at the end of a year, his funds becoming
exhausted, he was forced to make the return journey
to Prague on foot, nothing is known of his life at
Heidelberg.</p>

<p>Back in his native country after these years of study
and travel in Germany, he was still too young by two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
years for ordination in the brotherhood. Meanwhile
he turned his attention to education, and engaged himself
as a teacher in the elementary school at Prerau
conducted by the Moravian Brethren. This experience
brought him face to face with problems of methodology
and discipline, and gave him an opportunity to
apply some of the theories he had formulated while a
student at Herborn. His attention was at once called
to the ineffective methods employed in teaching Latin,
for the remedy of which he prepared an easy Latin
book for beginners.</p>

<p>His ordination took place at Zerwick on the 29th
day of April, 1616, although he continued teaching at
Prerau for two years longer, when he was called to
the pastorate of the flourishing Moravian church at
Fulneck. At the same time, or shortly thereafter, he
was elected superintendent of the schools of the town.
In this twofold capacity he ministered to the spiritual
and educational needs of Fulneck for three years, and
passed the only tranquil and happy years of his life.
But the year that ushered in this prosperous career
witnessed the outbreak of the Thirty Years’ War.</p>

<p>In 1621 Fulneck was sacked by the Spaniards, and
the conquering force gave itself up to destruction that
baffles description. Houses were pillaged, including
the residence of Comenius, and he lost all his property,
including his library and the manuscripts of
several educational treatises, on the composition of
which he had spent years of labor.</p>

<p>From this time on, the Moravian Brethren were
exposed to the most relentless persecutions. Many
were executed, and others took refuge in caves in the
wilderness or on the secluded estates of wealthy sym<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>pathizers.
For three years Comenius found an asylum
on the estate of Karl von Zerotin. The death of his
wife and children (for he had married while at Fulneck)
added to the afflictions of his exile; but he
sought relief from his sorrow in literary work—the
composition of a metrical translation of the Psalms, an
allegorical description of life, and the construction of
a highly meritorious map of Moravia.</p>

<p>The persecution of the enemies rendered concealment
no longer possible; and, although Karl von
Zerotin was held in high regard by Ferdinand II, in
1624 the imperial mandate was issued which banished
the evangelical clergy from the country. For a time
Comenius and several of his brethren secreted themselves
from their merciless pursuers on the Bohemian
mountains, in the citadel of Baron Sadowsky, near
Slaupna. But the edict of 1627 put an end to further
protection of the Moravian clergy by the nobles; and
in January, 1628, Comenius and many of his compatriots,
including his late protector, Baron Sadowsky,
set out for Poland. On the mountain frontier which
separates Moravia from Silesia, one gets an excellent
view of Fulneck and the surrounding country. Here
the band of exiles knelt and Comenius offered up an
impassioned prayer for his beloved Moravia and Bohemia.
This was his last sad look on his devoted country.
He never afterward beheld the land of his
fathers, but for more than half a century he lived an
exile in foreign regions. Well might he, in his old
age, exclaim: “My whole life was merely the visit of
a guest; I had no fatherland.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> the flight from Bohemia, Comenius and his
compatriots found a refuge at Lissa, Poland, with
Count Raphael, a powerful prince of the faith of the
Moravian Brethren, to whose estate hundreds of persecuted
Bohemians had already fled. Twelve years
were passed in Lissa, during which time Comenius
was actively engaged in educational reform. Besides
the composition of three of his most important books—the
<i>Janua</i>, in 1631, the <i>Great didactic</i>, probably in
1632, and the <i>School of infancy</i>, in 1633—he engaged
actively in the work of teaching. A secondary school
of acknowledged repute had been maintained in Lissa
by the Moravian Brethren since 1555, and here
Comenius found the opportunity of putting into practice
some of his educational theories. It is apparent,
however, from his writings, that he read widely before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
undertaking the reorganization of the gymnasium at
Lissa, and that he sought aid from all the writers on
education, both ancient and modern. His correspondents
at this period included such distinguished
names as Lubin, Andreæ, Ritter, Vogel, Ratke, Frey,
Mencel, Hartlib, Evenius, Johnstone, and Mochinger.
To these distinguished contemporaries he expresses
his dissatisfaction with current educational practices,
and seeks guidance in the reform movement he has
instituted in Poland.</p>

<p>“When our people attend school for the sake of the
learned languages, what do they bring with them on
returning home?” he asks. “What beyond that which
they obtain there—the tinkling of human eloquence,
the love of disputation, and the knowledge that puffeth
up instead of the charity that buildeth up. Moreover,
some acquire corrupt morals; some, a desire to make
themselves agreeable by a show of external civility;
some, habits of intemperance and a distaste or hatred
of firm discipline. And yet these very men were
trained for the lights of the Church and the pillars of
the State. O that, instead of such an education, we
had retained the simplicity of childhood. O that we
might bring back the ancient custom of the Spartans,
who, more than all the other Greeks, were intent upon
the rational education of their youth.”</p>

<p>A noteworthy feature of his work as a reformer at
Lissa consisted in a careful grading of the schools, and
the formulation of a course of study for the successive
grades. The guiding principle in this schematization
of school work was that each grade should pave
the way for the one next higher,—the elements of all
subjects of study being comparatively simple, these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
elements should be gradually introduced and elaborated
from grade to grade. These reforms were not
only far-reaching, they were revolutionary; and they
made possible the modern graded school.</p>

<p>Civilized Europe did not long remain in ignorance
of these reforms. They were discussed with approval
in England, Germany, France, and Sweden; and several
foreign governments sought his services in the
work of educational reform. Sweden, in 1638, tendered
him a remunerative position and unlimited
opportunities of reforming the schools of the kingdom
along the lines laid down in his writings. He replied
that he was willing to recommend a competent person
to undertake the work, but that he was not in position
to sever his relations with the Moravian Church in
Poland and to leave unfinished some important
educational writings.</p>

<p>His own poverty, as well as that of his brethren,
made him realize keenly the need of a wealthy patron
to aid him in the realization of his educational ideals.
“The vastness of the labors I contemplate,” he wrote,
“demands that I should have a wealthy patron,
whether we look at their extent, or at the necessity of
securing assistants, or at the expense generally. I
propose to render the study of science, philosophy,
and theology more accessible to all parties, and of
greater usefulness in the regulation of human affairs
than has hitherto been the case. In order to do this,
two kinds of books are necessary—(1) for philosophical
research and (2) for elementary training.</p>

<p>“Books of the first class would primarily have reference
to the Latin language, and of this class I would
adopt eight:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span></p>

<p>“1. The <i>Vestibulum</i>, or introduction to the Latin
tongue.</p>

<p>“2. The <i>Janua</i>, or gate of the Latin tongue.</p>

<p>“3. The <i>Palace</i>, or essentials of the Latin language.</p>

<p>“4. A dictionary giving the meaning of the Latin
words in the mother-tongue.</p>

<p>“5. A dictionary giving all the words of the native
language in Latin, and more especially supplying
phrases of the former language with corresponding
phrases in the latter.</p>

<p>“6. A Latin dictionary explaining all the peculiar
idioms of the language.</p>

<p>“7. An elementary grammar containing all the
declensions and conjugations, and to be used in
connection with the <i>Vestibulum</i>.</p>

<p>“8. A more comprehensive grammar, to be used in
connection with the <i>Janua</i>.</p>

<p>“The books to be used in connection with elementary
training are three:—</p>

<p>“1. <i>Pansophia</i>, or universal wisdom. This book
should comprise the sum total of human wisdom, and
be so expressed as to meet the requirements of both
the present and future ages. The method to be followed
in such a book would be to reduce it to certain
fundamental principles, beyond the compass of which
no part of human knowledge can reach. Such first
principles are God, the world, and common sense.</p>

<p>“2. <i>Panhistoria</i>, or universal history. This work
must comprehend the most vital facts of all ages.
Universal history is a most excellent handmaid of the
understanding, searching into the causes of all things,
and inquiring into the laws of cause and effect. Instruction
in history must be graded. It might be ar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>ranged
in six classes—Bible history, natural history,
history of inventions, history of morals, history of the
various religious rites, and general history.</p>

<p>“3. General dogmatics. These have to treat of
the different theories taken by human ingenuity, the
false as well as the true, thereby preventing a relapse
into vain speculations and dangerous errors.</p>

<p>“One man is not able to accomplish an undertaking
of such magnitude. There ought to be some clever
linguists, perhaps three well versed in philosophy, an
able historian, and a man thoroughly acquainted with
Biblical literature. As regards the philological labors,
I have already met with an excellent assistant in Mr.
Wechner. Nor are clever coadjutors wanting for the
<i>Pansophia</i>, who have not only offered the treasures of
their libraries, but who have offered themselves in
their coöperation in this work. Among these my
friend Hartlib far excels. I do not know his equal
in the extent of his knowledge, his acuteness of reasoning,
his zeal to become useful to the welfare of
mankind, his fervent love for a philosophy unmixed
with errors and fanciful speculations, and his self-denial
in order to further the objects in view.”</p>

<p>Such a patron, however, was not at once forthcoming,
although it would appear from his letters that Count
Bohulslaw of Lissa, whom he styles “the chief in the
kingdom of Poland,” was of some pecuniary assistance
to him at this time in the development of his theories.</p>

<p>The wide publication of his writings aroused a keen
interest in his reforms, and especially in England.
Samuel Hartlib, who corresponded extensively with
the learned men of Europe, had already translated
into English several of the educational writings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
Comenius, and in various other ways had interested
the English public in the work of the Moravian
reformer.</p>

<p>The keen personal interest of Hartlib in the work
of Comenius had important temporary consequences
on the direction of the reformer’s activities during the
next few years. Hartlib at this time was the most
interesting figure in English educational history.
“Everybody knew him,” says Professor Masson.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a>
“He was a foreigner by birth, being the son of a
Polish merchant who had left Poland when the country
fell under Jesuit rule, and had settled in Elbing
in Prussia, in very good circumstances. Twice married
before to Polish ladies, this merchant had married
in Prussia for his third wife the daughter of a wealthy
English merchant at Dantzig; and thus our Hartlib,
their son, though Prussian born and with Polish connections,
could reckon himself half English. The date
of his birth was probably about the beginning of the
century. He appears to have first visited England in
or about 1628, and from that time, though he made frequent
journeys to the continent, London had been his
headquarters. Here, with a residence in the city, he
carried on business as a merchant, with extensive
foreign correspondence, and very respectable family
connections. But it did not require such family connections
to make Hartlib at home in English society.
The character of the man would have made him at
home anywhere. He was one of those persons now
styled philanthropists, or friends of progress, who
take an interest in every question or project of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
time promising social improvement, have always some
irons in the fire, are constantly forming committees,
or writing letters to persons of influence, and live
altogether for the public. By the common consent of
all who have explored the intellectual and social history
of England in the seventeenth century, he is one
of the most interesting and memorable figures of that
whole period. He is interesting both for what he did
himself and on account of the number and intimacy of
his contacts with other interesting people.”</p>

<p>Through Hartlib’s influence the English Parliament
invited Comenius to England. This was in the summer
of 1641. Comenius himself may be permitted
to tell how all this came about: “After my <i>Pansophia</i>
had been published and dispersed through the various
countries of Europe, many learned men approved of
the object and plan of the work, but despaired of its
ever being accomplished by one man alone, and therefore
advised that a college of learned men should be
instituted to carry it into effect. Mr. Samuel Hartlib,
who had forwarded its publication in England,
labored earnestly in this matter, and endeavored by
every possible means to bring together for this purpose
a number of intellectual men. And at length,
having found one or two, he invited me with many
strong entreaties. As my friends consented to my
departure, I proceeded to London, and arrived there
on the autumnal equinox (September the 22d) in the
year 1641, and then learned that I had been called
thither by an order of the Parliament. But, in consequence
of the king having gone to Scotland, the Parliament
had been dismissed for three months, and,
consequently, I had to winter in London.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span></p>

<p>His friends meanwhile examined with more detail
his educational views and encouraged him to elaborate
his views in a tract, which he named <i>Via lucis</i>, or the
way of light. This, as he himself says, was “a national
disquisition as to the manner in which wisdom—the
intellectual law of minds—may at length
toward the evening of the world be felicitously diffused
through all minds in all nations.”</p>

<p>Around Comenius Hartlib soon collected a group of
thoughtful men interested in the Moravian reformer’s
views; and together we may suppose they discussed
at length the larger educational problems already
formulated by Comenius in his published writings.
The group included, besides Hartlib, Mr. John Pell,
a mathematician of acknowledged repute; John Milton,
the poet and educational writer; Theodor Haak,
the expositor of philosophic systems; John Wilkins,
the agricultural enthusiast; John Durie, the advocate
of evangelical unity; Thomas Farnaby, the schoolmaster
at Sevenoaks and one of the English editors
of Comenius’ <i>Janua</i>; and probably the American
Winthrop, later governor of Connecticut, who was
wintering in London. He was delighted with London
and the people he met. Writing to friends in Lissa,
he says: “I live as a friend among friends; though
not so many visit me as would if they knew that I
could speak English, or if they had more confidence
in their own Latin.”</p>

<p>When Parliament finally convened “and my presence
being known,” writes Comenius, “I was commanded
to wait until after some important business
having been transacted, a commission should be issued
to certain wise and learned Englishmen to hear me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
and be informed of my plan. As an earnest, moreover,
of their intentions, they communicated to me their
purpose to assign to us a college with revenues,
whence some men of learning and industry selected
from any nation might be honorably sustained either
for a certain number of years or in perpetuity. The
Savoy in London, and beyond London, Winchester,
and again near the city, Chelsea, were severally mentioned,
and inventories of the latter and its revenues
were communicated to me; so that nothing seemed
more certain than that the designs of Lord Bacon to
open a universal college of all nations, devoted solely
to the advancement of the sciences, were now in way
of being carried into effect.”</p>

<p>Comenius had assumed that when the call to England
came to him at Lissa, it simply represented a
private movement backed by Hartlib and other influential
Englishmen; and he expresses himself in terms
of delighted surprise upon arriving in London to find
that he had been summoned thither by the Parliament
of the realm. The parliamentary sanction of this
summons has never been corroborated. Professor
Masson made the attempt, but was unable to find in
the Lords’ or Commons’ <i>Journal</i> for the years 1641
and 1642 any traces of communication between
Comenius and the Parliament of which he speaks.
He admits that there may be such corroborative evidence,
since the indexes for these years are incomplete.
There are, however, no good and sufficient
reasons for doubting the word of Comenius in this
matter.</p>

<p>There are traces at this period of parliamentary dissatisfaction
with current English education, and more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
particularly with university education in England.
Professor Masson thus states the matter: “There had
for some time been a tradition of dissatisfaction with
the existing state of the universities and the great
public schools. In especial, Bacon’s complaints and
suggestions in the second book of his <i>De Augmentis</i>
had sunk into thoughtful minds. That the universities,
by persistence in old and outworn methods, were not
in full accord with the demands and needs of the age;
that their aims were too professional and particular,
and not sufficiently scientific and general; that the
order of studies in them was bad, and some of the
studies barren; that there ought to be a bold direction
of their endowments and apparatus in the line of
experimental knowledge, so as to extract from nature
new secrets and sciences for which humanity was
panting; that, moreover, there ought to be more fraternity
and correspondence among the universities of
Europe and some organization of their labors, with a
view to mutual illumination and collective advancement:—all
these Verulamian speculations, first submitted
to King James, were lying here and there in
English intellects in watch for an opportunity.”</p>

<p>But the time was not yet come for the reform movement
in English education. Ireland was in a state of
commotion; two hundred thousand Englishmen had
been massacred;<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> the sudden departure of the king
from London on the 10th of January, 1642, and the
prospect of a prolonged civil war convinced Comenius
that it would be useless to tarry longer in England.
He informed his friends of his disappointment of his
plans. Hartlib was hopeful and urged delay, but a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
call to Sweden, made four years previous, was renewed
at this time, and he left London on the 10th of June,
in the year 1642.</p>

<p>Lewis de Geer, a rich Dutch merchant and philanthropist,
residing at Nordköping, Sweden, had
offered to render him financial aid in working out his
educational reforms in Sweden. But de Geer’s
notions of reform differed widely from those of the
English friends. He was less interested in universal
research, the founding of pansophic colleges, and the
results of original investigation than Hartlib and the
Englishmen. What he wanted was better school-books
for the children, rational methods of teaching
for the teachers, and some intelligent grading of the
schools. The English friends were satisfied with the
broad generalities of pansophic learning, the unrealized
dreams that were so very near the reformer’s
heart; the Dutch merchant would be satisfied with
nothing less than concrete applications of theories.
There is no doubt that Comenius would have preferred
lingering in England or going to some place where his
cherished pansophic schemes might be given a hearing.
But he was human and had organic needs, and
he knew that the liberal remuneration offered him by
de Geer would avert poverty even though the realization
of his pure and exalted pansophic dream was
deferred.</p>

<p>“In the history of great renunciations,” says Mr.
Keatinge,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> “surely none is stranger than this. We
have a man little past the prime of life, his brain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
teeming with magnificent, if somewhat visionary,
plans for social reform, a mighty power in the community
that shaved his religious ideas, and an object
of interest even to those who may have shrugged their
shoulders at his occasional want of balance. Suddenly
he flings his projects to the winds, consigns his darling
plans to the dustheap of unrealizable ideas, and
retires to a small seaside town—not to meditate, not
to give definite form to latent conceptions or to evolve
new ones, not to make preparation for the dazzling
of intellectual Europe with an octavo of fantastic
philanthropy or of philosophic mysticism, but—to
write school-books for the little boys in Swedish
schools.”</p>

<p>Comenius went from London to Nordköping, where
he spent some days in conference with his new patron,
Lewis de Geer. He was not to receive a stipulated
salary, but to be paid certain sums upon the completion
of definite texts, the number and character of the
same to be determined by the educational authorities
at Stockholm, whither de Geer directed Comenius to
go for further orders. In Stockholm he met with
Lord Axel Oxenstiern, grand chancellor of the kingdom
of Sweden, and Dr. John Skyte, professor of
canon and civil law (as well as chancellor) in the University
of Upsala. Of this conference Comenius says:
“These two exercised me in debate for four days, and
chiefly Oxenstiern, that eagle of the north. He
inquired into the foundations of both my schemes, the
didactic and the pansophic, so searchingly that it was
unlike anything that had been done before by any of
my learned critics. In the first two days he examined
the didactics, with, at length, this conclusion: ‘From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
an early age,’ said he, ‘I perceived that our method
of studies generally in use is a harsh and crude one,
but where the root of the trouble was I couldn’t find
out. At length having been sent by my king [Gustavus
Adolphus], of glorious memory, as ambassador
into Germany, I conversed on the subject with various
learned men. And when I heard that Wolfgang Ratke
was toiling at a reformed method, I had no rest of mind
until I had got that gentleman into my presence; but,
instead of a talk on the subject, he offered me a big
volume in quarto to read. I swallowed that trouble;
and, having gone through the book, I noted that he
detected not badly the maladies of the schools; but
the remedies he proposed did not seem to me sufficient.
Yours, Mr. Comenius, rest on firmer foundations.’”<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<p>The consultation with Oxenstiern and Skyte continued
four days, at the conclusion of which they rendered
their decision on his various theories. With
reference to his pansophic notions, they saw little of
immediate utility to the welfare of mankind. But his
didactics they regarded with favor. They urged him
to give his attention to the reformation of teaching
and the preparation of suitable text-books. While
somewhat chagrined at this unsympathetic attitude
toward his pansophic theories, and a little surprised
to learn that de Geer should be of the same mind, he
was forced to acquiesce, not, however, without the earnest
solicitations of Hartlib and his English friends
not to forsake the cherished pansophic principles.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span></p>

<p>The town of Elbing, on the Baltic Sea, in West
Prussia, was designated by de Geer as a suitable
residence for Comenius during the time that he should
be in the service of the Swedish educational department.
Here he settled, with his family and the
assistants de Geer had permitted him to employ at
the patron’s expense, in October, 1642. The chief
task imposed upon him was the compilation of a
series of text-books for use in elementary and secondary
schools. But progress was slow; the Swedes
became impatient, and de Geer grew restive. In consequence,
the relations with his patron soon became
strained, and continued so during most of the Elbing
period. In reply to a complaint from de Geer,
Comenius wrote him in September, 1643: “I compose
books and do not merely copy those of others. Our
proposed work is not merely a book, but a real treasure
for the aiding of whose production my patron will
assuredly have no cause for regret.” He admits that
he has been diverted from the completion of a work on
language teaching by a philosophic treatise which he
considers of far greater importance than the details
of methodology.</p>

<p>In addition to the philosophic studies, in which de
Geer and the Swedes had little or no interest, Comenius
dissipated his energies in other ways. When
it became generally known that he had located in
Elbing, the wealthy patrons of the local high school
petitioned the town council to secure him to give
weekly lectures to the pupils. In other ways he identified
himself with local interests, which diverted his
time from his assigned tasks. Moreover, his connection
with the Moravian Brethren compelled him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
make frequent trips to Poland to attend ecclesiastical
conventions and minister to the needs of the scattered
brethren. De Geer’s patience must have been sorely
tried, for he sent to Elbing, with annoying frequency,
to inquire concerning the progress of the work. In
reply, Comenius begged his patron have patience; he
explained the difficult nature of his labors, and assured
him that he was making as much progress as was consistent
with the nature of his undertaking.</p>

<p>Toward the close of 1646 he went to Sweden and
made a personal report to his patron, covering the four
years of his employment. A government committee
was appointed to review his work; its report was most
favorable to Comenius; and he was urged to get the
work in shape for immediate publication. He had
prepared during this time, in spite of distractions, a
work on language teaching, which treated of its nature,
function, and the laws to be observed in language
teaching; a lexicon based on these laws; and a series
of graded reading books.</p>

<p>At the death of Justinus, the senior bishop of the
Moravian Brethren in 1648, Comenius was elected his
successor. His new duties made his removal to Lissa
necessary, and he took with him the unfinished
treatises for the Swedes, and sent them to de Geer as
rapidly as he was able to complete them. It caused
him no pang of sorrow to sever his connection with
the Dutch merchant and the Swedes. For he was
isolated at Elbing; his labors were uncongenial, and
the remuneration which he received was small. It is
apparent from his letters, subsequently written, that
it was not merely the Dutchman’s gold that held him
to tasks so arduous and uncongenial. He hoped by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
this connection to secure the moral support of the
Swedes in removing from the Moravian Brethren the
ban which exiled them from their beloved fatherland.</p>

<p>The treaty of Westphalia, however, shattered this
hope. There was not a single stipulation in favor
of the exiled brethren. The promises Sweden had
made to Comenius in this matter were disregarded.
In vain he implored Oxenstiern not to forsake his
people. “My people have aided your arms with their
weapons, the unceasing offerings of their tears and
supplications to God; and now, when they see your
success and may rejoice in the hope for a more favorable
issue of affairs, they are troubled with dread
apprehension lest they should be forsaken.” Later he
wrote him: “Of what use is it to us, who are now deprived
of every hope of peace, to have assisted you with
our tears in obtaining victory; when, although it lay
within your power to release us from our prison-house,
you surrender us anew into the hands of our oppressors?
Of what avail now all those holy evangelical
alliances formed by our ancestors, and consecrated
with their sacred martyr-blood?”<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> But these importunities
were of no avail; for, while equal privileges
were granted to the Reformed, Lutheran, and Catholic
churches in Germany, in Bohemia, and Moravia, the
ritual of the latter alone was established. It was a
severe blow to Comenius, as well as to the whole
brotherhood of the Moravian Church.</p>

<p>The years 1648 to 1650 were passed in ministrations
to the dispersed brethren;<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> he was especially conscien<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>tious
in the discharge of the duties of his episcopal
office; he established more intimate relations between
the Polish and Hungarian branches of the Moravian
churches; he sought and secured important financial
aid for the brotherhood in England, Holland, and
Sweden; he secured positions as teachers for many of
his exiled countrymen; and induced the University
of Oxford to create stipends for Bohemian students.
Gindely remarks that at this period there were few
European countries in which the protégés of Comenius
could not be found in the capacity of private tutors,
public school-teachers, artists, or clergymen.</p>

<p>The impoverished condition of the Moravian Church
caused Comenius no little concern, and induced him to
look with some favor on the numerous calls to important
educational posts which came to him from foreign
countries. That from the widow of Prince Rakoczy
and her son Sigismund was especially tempting. They
wanted him to come to Transylvania, Hungary, and
reform the school system. A liberal salary was offered,
together with complete facilities for the organization
of a school system in accordance with his own views—including
a printing establishment for the publication
of required books. It was further stipulated that
he might bring with him ten or a dozen Bohemian
youths to be educated at the expense of the prince and
his mother. The scattered members of the Moravian
Church in Hungary, in the belief that the presence of
the bishop in that country would unify the interests
of the brotherhood, also urged him to accept the Transylvanian
call, at the same time petitioning the general
synod to relieve Comenius of his clerical functions
at Lissa for a few years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span></p>

<p>The Church granted the petition, and Comenius
settled in Saros-Patak, in May, 1650. He at once
drew up a sketch of a seven-grade school, which he
published a year later under the title <i>Plan of a pansophic
school</i>. “In scope and breadth of view,”
remarks a modern historian, “the scheme was centuries
in advance of its time, while many of the suggestions
which it contained are but imperfectly carried
into effect at the present day.”</p>

<p>The <i>Plan</i> is a detailed course of study with specific
directions for the application of the course for the use
of teachers. In these directions he explains the great
danger of overworking the children; and to avoid this,
a rest-pause of a half-hour is provided after each
hour’s instruction for free, spontaneous play. After
each meal a full hour’s rest is granted. The pupils
are to have eight hours of sleep; they are granted a
half-holiday on Sundays and Wednesdays, with fortnight
vacations at Christmas, Easter, and Whitsuntide,
and a month’s vacation in the summer. This
gave a school year of forty-two weeks, with thirty
hours for school work in each week. The forenoon
instruction was as follows: From 6 to 7 o’clock,
religious instruction, including hymns, prayers, and
Bible readings. From 7.30 to 8.30, theoretical exposition
of the new subject-matter of the day’s lesson;
and from 9 to 10, a practical treatment and review of
the same. There was music (and mathematics) in
the afternoon from 1 to 2; history from 2.30 to 3.30;
and composition, with exercises in style, from 4 to 5.</p>

<p>The <i>Plan</i> requires that the seven grades of the
school meet in separate rooms, and that a teacher be
provided for each grade. In each class, the text-books<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
must be adapted to the capacities of the children. The
Vestibulum is the lowest class. Over the door of this
room is the motto, “Let no one enter who cannot
read.” The room is so decorated that the pictures
illustrate the subjects taught in this grade; and, by
means of these illustrations, the senses are trained.
The pupils are taught short maxims containing the
most important rules of conduct, a few common Latin
words, the elements of arithmetic, the scales in music,
and some short hymns and prayers. Writing and
drawing are also taught, and special attention is given
to the games of the children.</p>

<p>The Janual is the second class. The motto over
the class-room door of this grade is, “Let no one enter
who is ignorant of mathematics.” Provided the more
common objects mentioned in the <i>Janua</i> cannot be
readily obtained, pictures of these objects are hung on
the wall. The text-books used are, besides the <i>Janua</i>,
the Latin vernacular dictionary and the Janual grammar.
In composition, the pupils are exercised in the
structure of phrases, sentences, and periods; in religion,
they learn the catechism; in mathematics, addition
and subtraction and plane figures in geometry.
There are more advanced exercises in music; and, as
in the preceding grade, the teachers are urged to
encourage the plays and games of the children.</p>

<p>The Atrial is the third class. Its motto is, “Let no
one enter who cannot speak.” Here Bible readings,
in abridged form and suited to the intelligence of the
children, are begun. The text-book is the <i>Atrium</i>,
together with a grammar of eloquence and a Latin-Latin
dictionary. In arithmetic, the pupils master
multiplication and division, and in geometry, solid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
figures. The musical instruction includes harmony
and the rudiments of Latin verse. Famous deeds in
Biblical narrative furnish the basis of the historic
instruction. In composition there are exercises in
style, consisting of paraphrasing and the transposition
of sentences. Before the pupils are permitted to pass
from this grade they must be able to read the Latin
authors readily and to converse in the Latin fluently.</p>

<p>The Philosophical is the fourth class, with the
motto, “Let no one who is ignorant of history enter
here.” The walls are decorated with pictures illustrative
of arithmetic, geometry, and physics, and connected
with this class-room are a chemical laboratory
and a dissecting-room. The religious instruction
includes hymns, Psalms, an epitome of the New Testament,
and a life of Christ. The text-book is called
the <i>Palace of wisdom</i>; in it the genesis of natural phenomena
are described. In mathematics, the pupils
learn the rules of proportion; they begin the study of
trigonometry; also statics, and instruction on musical
instruments. Greek is begun, and the pupils study
natural history through Pliny and Ælian. Comenius
mentions that he does not consider Greek a difficult
study; and he thinks it need cause the pupils no
alarm, since an exhaustive knowledge of Greek is not
required, and the difficulties of the study will be
largely overcome by the use of rational methods of
teaching.</p>

<p>The fifth class is the Logical. Over the door is the
inscription, “Let no one enter who is ignorant of
natural philosophy,” and the walls are covered with
the rules of logic. The pupils have a Bible manual
and a class-book on problems in philosophy. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
problems include a survey of things that have been
and may be discovered by man; a formal logic explaining
the processes of reasoning, and a repertory of such
philosophical problems as present themselves to the
human mind. In arithmetic, the rules of partnership
and allegation are studied; in geometry, mensuration
of heights and distances and plane surfaces; in geography,
a description of the earth; in astronomy, an
account of the heavens; in history, a survey of
mechanical inventions. For the formation of a literary
style, such historians as Curtius, Cæsar, and Justin
are read. The study of Greek is continued, and
Isocrates and Plutarch are recommended for reading.
Dramatic performances are introduced in the fifth
class. Grammar, logic, and metaphysics are represented
in conflict, but a reconciliation is finally effected
through study.</p>

<p>The sixth is the Political class. Its motto, “Let
no one enter who cannot reason.” Sallust, Cicero,
Virgil, and Horace are read for style; provision is
made for verse writing; attention is given to geography
and the parts of astronomy dealing with the
planets and the laws of the eclipses; the Bible is read
through; more advanced topics in arithmetic and geometry
are taken up; the special class-book studied deals
with human society and the laws of economics; in
Greek the pupils read from Thucydides and Hesiod.
Dramatic performances are continued, the degeneration
and moral downfall of Solomon being rendered.</p>

<p>The seventh and last grade of the course is the
Philosophic. Its motto is, “Let no one enter who
is irreligious.” The instruction is of an essentially
theological character. On the walls are inscribed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
numerous mystic symbols illustrative of the hidden
wisdom of the Holy Scriptures. The most devotional
Psalms and church hymns are used in the school exercises.
There are readings from the Scriptures, the
works of the most inspired theologians and martyrs,
and a <i>résumé</i> of Christian beliefs, duties, and aspirations,
all written in the phraseology of the Bible.
The text-book of the grade is ultra-religious in character.
It includes (1) an account of the earthly and
heavenly revelations of God; (2) a commentary for
Scriptural reading; and (3) a detailed account of the
mysteries of salvation. In arithmetic, the sacred and
mystic numbers that occur in the Scriptures; in architecture,
the sacred structures as exemplified by Noah’s
ark, the tabernacle, and the Temple; in history, the
general history of the Church; and in ancient language,
Hebrew takes the place of Greek—this, that the students
may be able to read and understand the Scriptures
in the original text. Oratory is studied that those
who become preachers may know how to address a
congregation, and that those who engage in politics
may know how to reason with their hearers.</p>

<p>Such is a condensed survey of the course of study
which Comenius devised for the schools at Saros-Patak;
and in no small degree his reputation as a
reformer rests upon this piece of work. For the
Saros-Patak <i>Plan</i> became a model for educators in
many lands, and the progenitor of a long line of graded
schemes of instruction which constitute such an essential
feature of the educational economy of to-day. Not
only were subjects of study graded in accordance with
the laws of the development of child-mind, but text-books
were graded as well. Moreover, the scheme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
made necessary the employment of teachers who comprehended
the character of the work, and, more particularly,
those with some appreciation of the natural
history of the child and the causes which condition its
growth. Little as Comenius understood psychology,
at least in the modern use of that term, he was alive
to the fact that in childhood the senses are keenest,
and that the line of least resistance in the acquisition
of new impressions is through (1) objects, (2) pictures,
and (3) interesting verbal descriptions in the mother-tongue.</p>

<p>His labors at Saros-Patak terminated at the close of
the fourth year, during which time the first three
grades of the <i>Plan</i> were organized. All contemporary
evidence confirms the success of the scheme. Although
so marked a departure from traditional educational
practices, it succeeded to a degree that must have
been surprising even to Comenius himself. The fact
that the teachers in the schools were trained under
Comenius at Lissa did much, doubtless, to remove
otherwise possible frictions.</p>

<p>But careful gradation was not the only marked
reform carried out at Saros-Patak during this period.
Pictures were introduced as aids in teaching, and the
first child’s picture book, the first of a long line of
books so popular in our own day, was written. This
was the famous <i>Orbis pictus</i>, to be discussed in a
subsequent chapter.</p>

<p>Comenius returned to Lissa in 1654, to resume his
ecclesiastical labors. But his sojourn was brief; for,
with the invasion of Poland by the Swedes, came the
fall and conflagration of the city. Comenius escaped,
“almost in a state of nudity,” to use his own words.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
He had not only lost his property and his library in
the conflagration, but he had sustained a yet greater
loss in the burning of his numerous manuscripts, and,
more important (to him) than all the others, his entire
pansophic work, on the composition of which he had
labored so arduously for many years. Writing to
Montanus, he says, “The loss of this work I shall
cease to lament only when I cease to breathe.” He
escaped from Lissa to Silesia, where he found refuge
for a time in the home of a nobleman. He shortly
afterward pushed on to Frankfort, but not feeling
secure here he moved to Hamburg, where for two
months he was prostrated by a severe illness.</p>

<small>CLOSING YEARS: 1656–1670</small></h2></div>

freedom in Holland—Publication of the complete edition of his
writings—Other educational activities—The “One thing needful”—Death
at Amsterdam and burial at Naärden—Family
history of Comenius—Alleged call to the presidency of Harvard
College—Portraits—Personal characteristics.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">During</span> his last year’s residence at Saros-Patak,
Comenius had sustained a great loss in the death of
his friend and former patron, Lewis de Geer. In a
funeral oration which he composed, he characterized
his benefactor as “a man pious toward God, just
toward men, merciful to the distressed, and meritoriously
great and illustrious among all men.” The rich
Dutch merchant bequeathed his estates to his son,
Lawrence de Geer of Amsterdam; and not only his
estates, but also his deep interest in the welfare of the
Moravian reformer.</p>

<p>Learning of the severe illness of Comenius, Lawrence
de Geer wrote him to leave Hamburg and come directly
to Amsterdam, where all the needs of his closing years
would be provided. The younger de Geer, it would
seem, had not only a real and profound affection for
the aged Comenius, but also a keen and intelligent
interest in all his schemes for educational reform.</p>

<p>Amsterdam proved, indeed, a haven of rest to the
weary wanderer. At this time the city enjoyed greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
religious freedom than perhaps any other city in
Europe. Says Benham: “Comenius found himself in
the midst of a community then enjoying the largest
amount of religious toleration to be found anywhere in
Europe, and with it a great diversity of religious
opinions. Unitarians expelled from their own countries
here united themselves to the friends of speculative
philosophy among the Remonstrants and
Arminians; and the philosophy of Descartes here
found admirers even among the members of the
Reformed Church. The truly evangelical Comenius
had become known to many through his writings,
which, together with the influence of his patron’s son,
Lawrence de Geer, who continued his father’s benevolence,
induced rich merchants to intrust him with the
education of their sons; so that, with the additions
accruing from his literary labors, Comenius found a
supply of food and raiment, and was thereby content.”</p>

<p>In spite of his advanced age, these closing years of
his life at Amsterdam were busy ones; for besides
ministering to the needs of the scattered and disheartened
ecclesiastics of the Moravian Brethren, he engaged
somewhat in private teaching, and saw through
the press a complete edition of his educational writings.
It was a magnificent volume of more than a
thousand pages, and was printed by Christopher
Cunard and Gabriel à Roy under the title <i>All the
didactical works of J. A. Comenius</i>.</p>

<p>The publication of this handsome folio, containing
all his educational writings, was made possible by the
generosity of Lawrence de Geer. The first part of
the folio, written between 1627 and 1642, contains
(1) a brief narration of the circumstances which led<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
the author to write these studies; (2) the <i>Great
didactic</i>, showing the method of teaching all things;
(3) the <i>School of infancy</i>, being an essay on the education
of youth during the first six years; (4) an
account of a six-class vernacular school; (5) the
<i>Janua</i>; (6) the <i>Vestibulum</i>; (7) David Vechner’s <i>Model
of a temple of Latinity</i>; (8) a didactic dissertation on
the quadripartite study of the Latin language; (9) the
circle of all the sciences; (10) various criticisms on
the same; (11) explanations of attempts at pansophy.</p>

<p>The second part of the folio, written between 1642
and 1650, contains (1) new reasons for continuing to
devote attention to didactic studies; (2) new methods
of studying languages, built upon didactic foundations;
(3) vestibule of the Latin language adapted to the
laws of the most recent methods of language teaching;
(4) new gate of the Latin language exhibiting the
structure of things and words in their natural order;
(5) a Latin and German introductory lexicon explaining
a multitude of derived words; (6) a grammar of
the Latin and vernacular, with short commentaries;
(7) treatise on the Latin language of the <i>Atrium</i>;
(8) certain opinions of the learned on these new views
of language teaching.</p>

<p>The third part of the work, written between 1650
and 1654, contains (1) a brief account of his call to
Hungary; (2) a sketch of the seven-class pansophic
school; (3) an oration on the culture of innate capacities;
(4) an oration on books as the primary instruments
in the cultivation of innate capacities; (5) on
the obstacles to the acquisition of encyclopædic culture
and some means of removing these obstacles; (6) a
short and pleasant way of learning to read and under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>stand
the Latin authors; (7) on scholastic erudition;
(8) on driving idleness from the schools; (9) laws for
a well-regulated school; (10) the <i>Orbis pictus</i>; (11) on
scholastic play; (12) valedictory oration delivered on
the occasion of the completion of his labors at Saros-Patak;
(13) funeral oration on the life and character
of Lewis de Geer.</p>

<p>The fourth part of the work represents the years
from 1654 to 1657. It contains (1) an account of the
author’s didactic studies; (2) a little boy to little
boys, or all things to all; (3) apology for the Latinity
of Comenius; (4) the art of wisely reviewing one’s
own opinions; (5) exits from scholastic labyrinths into
the open plain; (6) the formation of a Latin college;
(7) the living printing-press, or the art of impressing
wisdom compendiously, copiously, and elegantly, not
on paper, but on the mind; (8) the best condition of
the mind; (9) a devout commendation of the study of
wisdom.</p>

<p>In addition to his literary labors, he gave much time
to the administration of church affairs; for Lissa had
risen from her ashes and was more prosperous than
before the war. Here congregated again many adherents
of the Moravian brotherhood, and the college was
rebuilt and resumed its beneficent pedagogic influence.
From this centre the Moravian influence
spread anew to many parts of Europe. England,
Prussia, and other Protestant countries were generous
in their contributions toward the restoration of Moravian
churches. All this money was sent to Comenius
at Amsterdam, and by him apportioned to the scattered
brethren. He received thirty thousand dollars
from England alone during the years 1658 and 1659;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
the only stipulation made in the disposition of the
money was that a portion of it should be used for the
printing of Polish and Bohemian Bibles. The last
years of his life were occupied almost wholly in such
ministrations.</p>

<p>He published in 1668 his swan song, the <i>One thing
needful</i>. This is his farewell address to the world.
It delineates in a forceful yet modest way his aspirations
for educational reform, gives expression of the
deep faith which sustained him during the long years
of his weary pilgrimage, and burns with enthusiastic
zeal for the welfare of mankind—the burning passion
of his life. He was well prepared at the advanced
age of seventy-six years to sum up the experience
of a long and afflicted life.</p>

<p>A few citations from this touching bit of reminiscence
will hint at the motives which actuated him in
his life-work as an educational reformer. “I thank
God that I have been all my life a man of aspirations;
and although He has brought me into many labyrinths,
yet He has so protected me that either I have soon
worked my way out of them, or He has brought me by
His own hand to the enjoyment of holy rest. For the
desire after good, if it is always in the heart, is a
living stream that flows from God, the fountain of all
good. The blame is ours if we do not follow the
stream to its source or to its overflow into the sea,
where there is fulness and satiety of good.”</p>

<p>“One of my chief employments has been the
improvement of schools, which I undertook and continued
for many years from the desire to deliver the
youth in the schools from the labyrinth in which they
are entangled. Some have held this business foreign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
to a theologian, as if Christ had not connected together
and given to his beloved disciple Peter at the same
time the two commands, ‘Feed my sheep’ and ‘Feed
my lambs.’ I thank Christ for inspiring me with
such affection toward his lambs, and for regulating my
exertions in the form of educational works. I trust
that when the winter of indifference has passed that
my endeavors will bring forth some fruit.”</p>

<p>“My life here was not my native country, but a
pilgrimage; my home was ever changing, and I found
nowhere an abiding resting place. But now I see my
heavenly country near at hand, to whose gates my
Saviour has gone before me to prepare the way. After
years of wandering and straying from the direction of
my journey, delayed by a thousand extraneous diversions,
I am at last within the bounds of the promised
land.”</p>

<p>The rest and peace and glory which he so hopefully
anticipated came to him at Amsterdam on the 15th of
November, in the year 1670. His remains were conveyed
to Naärden, a small town on the Zuyder Zee,
twelve miles east of Amsterdam, where they were
interred in the French Reformed Church, on the 22d
of November. The figure 8 was the only epitaph
placed on his tomb. More than a century afterward
the church was transformed into a military barracks,
and for many years the date of his death, the church
in which he was buried, and the grave inclosing his
remains were unknown. But in 1871 Mr. de Röper,
a lawyer residing in Naärden, found among his father’s
papers the church register, the sexton’s account book,
and other documents relating to the old French
Reformed Church. After the figure 8, in the church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
register, was this entry: “John Amos Comenius, the
famous author of the <i>Janua Linguarum</i>; interred the
22d of November, 1670.” A diligent search was
instituted, and the grave was found. An aged woman
residing in Naärden recalled the location of the French
Reformed Church as the present site of the barracks.
By permission of the commanding officer, an examination
was made and the tombstone marked 8 was found.
The remains were subsequently removed to a little
park in Naärden, where there was erected to his
memory, in 1892, by friends of education in Europe
and America, a handsome monument. This consists
of a pyramid of rough stones with two white marble
slabs containing gold-furrowed inscriptions in Latin,
Dutch, and Czech (Bohemian): “A grateful posterity
to the memory of John Amos Comenius, born at
Nivnitz on the 28th of March, 1592; died at Amsterdam
on the 15th of November, 1670; buried at Naärden
on the 22d of November, 1670. He fought a
good fight.” A room in the town hall at Naärden has
been set aside as a permanent Comenius museum,
where will be found a collection of his portraits, sets
of the different editions of his writings, and the old
stone slab containing the figure 8.</p>

<p>The present work being an educational rather than
a personal life of Comenius, no reference has thus far
been made to his family life. It may be noted briefly
that he married, in 1624, Elizabeth Cyrrill, with
whom he had five children, a son (Daniel) and four
daughters. Elizabeth died in 1648 and he married
again on the 17th of May, 1649, Elizabeth Gainsowa,
with whom he appears to have had no children. A
third marriage is mentioned by some of his biog<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>raphers,
but the statement lacks corroboration. One
daughter, Elizabeth, married Peter Figulus Jablonsky,
who was bishop of the Church from November, 1662,
until his death, January the 12th, 1670. Their son
Daniel Ernst Jablonsky was consecrated a bishop of
the Polish branch of the Moravian Church at Lissa
March the 10th, 1699. He served the Church until
his death, May the 25th, 1741.</p>

<p>An account of the life of Comenius would be incomplete
without some reference to his alleged call to
the presidency of Harvard College. This rests upon
an unconfirmed statement by Cotton Mather. In his
<i>Magnalia</i><a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> he says: “Mr. Henry Dunster continued
the Praesident of Harvard-College until his unhappy
Entanglement in the Snares of Anabaptism fill’d the
Overseers with uneasie Fears, lest the Students by his
means should come to be Ensnared: Which Uneasiness
was at length so signified unto him, that on
October 24, 1654, he presented unto the Overseers,
an Instrument under his Hands, wherein he Resigned
his Presidentship and they accepted his Resignation.
That brave Old Man Johannes Amos Commenius, the
Fame of whose Worth has been Trumpetted as far as
more than Three Languages (whereof every one is
Endebted unto his <i>Janua</i>) could carry it, was agreed
withall, by our Mr. Winthrop in his Travels through
the Low Countries to come over into New England
and Illuminate this College and Country in the Quality
of a President. But the Solicitations of the Swedish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
Ambassador, diverting him another way, that Incomparable
Moravian became not an American.”</p>

<p>The following evidence makes improbable this
call:—</p>

<p>1. Some years ago the writer asked Professor Paul
H. Hanus to ascertain for him if the records of Harvard
College corroborated Mather’s statement. After
examining the proceedings of the overseers and all
other records of the college during its early history,
he reported that he could not find the slightest corroboration
of Mather’s statement, and that he seriously
doubted its accuracy.</p>

<p>2. The historians of the college—Peirce, Quincy,
and Eliot—do not allude to the matter. And President
Josiah Quincy,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> in his complete and standard
history of the institution, refers to the “loose and
exaggerated terms in which Mather and Johnson, and
other writers of that period, speak of the early donations
to the college, and the obscurity, and not to say
confusion, in which they appear in the first records of
the seminary.”</p>

<p>3. Careful examination has been made of the
numerous lives of Comenius printed in the German
language, as well as those printed in the Czech; and,
although less noteworthy distinctions are recorded,
there is no mention of a call to Harvard College or
America.</p>

<p>4. In the <i>Journals</i> of Governor John Winthrop of
Massachusetts, there are no allusions to Comenius.
Governor Winthrop died in 1649; and it was not until
1653 that President Dunster fell “into the briers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
Antpædo-baptism,” when he bore “public testimony
in the church at Cambridge against the administration
of baptism to any infant whatsoever.” And the historians
of the college report that up to this time
(1653) Dunster’s administration had been singularly
satisfactory, so that there could have been no thought
of providing his successor before the death of Governor
Winthrop. Mather is either in error or he does not
refer to Governor Winthrop of Massachusetts. He
may refer to Governor Winthrop of Connecticut,
the eldest son of the Massachusetts governor, although
evidence is wanting to show that the Connecticut
governor had anything to do with the management of
Harvard College. Young Winthrop was in England
from August the 3d, 1641, until the early part of 1643.
It will be recalled that Comenius spent the winter of
1641–1642 in London, and the fact that both knew
Hartlib most intimately would suggest that they must
have met. In a letter which Hartlib wrote to Winthrop
after the latter’s return to America, he says, “Mr.
Comenius is continually diverted by particular controversies
of Socinians and others from his main
Pansophical Worke.”<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></p>

<p>5. Mather is clearly in error in regard to the date
of the call of Comenius to Sweden. The negotiations
were begun in 1641 and were completed in August of
the next year, so that the “solicitations of the Swedish
Ambassador diverting him another way” took
place more than twelve years before the beginning of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
the troubles at Cambridge which led to the resignation
of Dunster.</p>

<p>With so many flaws in Mather’s statement, and the
absence of corroborative evidence, it seems altogether
improbable that Comenius was ever called to the
presidency of Harvard College.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<p>In closing, brief mention may be made of his most
dominant physical and personal characteristics.
Several excellent portraits of Comenius are in existence,
the best perhaps being by Hollar and Glover.
From these it is apparent that he was a man of
imposing figure, with high forehead, long chin, and
soft, pathetic eyes. It is not difficult to read into
his sad, expressive countenance the force of the
expression in his last published utterance, “My
whole life was merely the visit of a guest; I had no
fatherland.”</p>

<p>There is no conflicting evidence on the personal life
of the reformer; but rather unanimous agreement on
the sweetness and beauty of his character. Says
Palacky: “In his intercourse with others, Comenius
was in an extraordinary degree friendly, conciliatory,
and humble; always ready to serve his neighbor and
sacrifice himself. His writings, as well as his walk
and conversation, show the depth of his feeling, his
goodness, his uprightness, and his fear of God. He
never cast back upon his opponents what they meted
out to him. He never condemned, no matter how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
great the injustice which he was made to suffer. At
all times, with fullest resignation, whether joy or
sorrow was his portion, he honored and praised the
Lord.” Raumer says of him: “Comenius is a grand
and venerable figure of sorrow. Wandering, persecuted,
and homeless during the terrible and desolating
Thirty Years’ War, he never despaired, but, with
enduring and faithful truth, labored unceasingly to
prepare youth by a better education for a better future.
His unfailing aspirations lifted up in a large part of
Europe many good men prostrated by the terrors of
the times and inspired them with the hope that by
pious and wise systems of education there might be
reared up a race of men more pleasing to God.” Well
might Herder say: “Comenius was a noble priest of
humanity, whose single end and aim in life was the
welfare of all mankind.”</p>

<h3><i>The Great Didactic</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Most</span> comprehensive of all of the educational writings
of Comenius is the <i>Great didactic</i>. It was
planned in 1628, while yet in the full possession of
his vigor, before misfortune had hampered his usefulness
and persecution had made him a wanderer.
Written originally in the Czech, it was translated into
the Latin and published at Amsterdam in 1657. The
original Czech manuscript was discovered at Lissa in
1841, and presented to the museum at Prague; but
the Austrian censors of the press forbade its publication
because Comenius was a Bohemian exile (!).
Through the exertions of the museum authorities, however,
it was allowed to be printed in 1849. Professor
Laurie gave English readers a summary of the <i>Great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
didactic</i> in his <i>Life and educational works of John
Amos Comenius</i> (London, 1883); but the first complete
translation was made by Mr. M. W. Keatinge of
Edinburgh in 1896.</p>

<p>The full title is: <i>The great didactic setting forth the
whole art of teaching all things to all men; or a certain
inducement to found such schools in all parishes, towns,
and villages of every Christian kingdom that the entire
youth of both sexes, none being excepted, shall quickly,
pleasantly, and thoroughly become learned in the sciences,
pure in morals, trained in piety, and in this manner instructed
in all things necessary for the present and future
life, in which, with respect to everything that is suggested,
its fundamental principles are set forth from the essential
nature of the matter, its truth is proved by examples, from
the several mechanical arts its order is clearly set forth in
years, months, days, and hours; and finally an easy and
sure method is shown by which it can be pleasantly
brought into existence</i>.</p>

<p>The purpose of the <i>Great didactic</i>, as announced by
Comenius in the preface, is to seek and find a method
of instruction by which teachers may teach less, but
learners may learn more; schools may be the scene of
less noise, aversion, and useless labor, but of more
leisure, enjoyment, and solid progress; the Christian
community have less darkness, perplexity, and dissension,
but more light, peace, and rest. He promises
in his “greeting” an “art of teaching all things
to all men, and of teaching them with certainty, so
that the result cannot fail.” Among the uses of such
an art he notes the advantage (1) to parents, that they
may know that if correct methods have been employed
with unerring accuracy, it is impossible that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
desired result should not follow; (2) to teachers, who,
without a knowledge of this art, try in turn first one
plan and then another—a course which involves a
tedious waste of time and energy; and (3) to schools,
that they may become places of amusement, houses of
delight and attraction, and that they may cause learning
to flourish. Such, in brief, are fundamental principles
of a philosophy of education. How well those
principles were elaborated and applied will be seen in
the exposition of his writings which follows.</p>


<h3><i>Purpose of Education</i></h3>

<p>The opening chapters of the <i>Great didactic</i> treat of
man as the highest, the most absolute, and the most
excellent of created beings: of the life beyond as
man’s ultimate end, and of this life as merely a preparation
for eternity. The human being passes through
three stages in his preparation for eternity—he learns
to know himself, to rule himself, and to direct himself
to God. Man’s natural craving is for knowledge,—learning,
virtue, piety,—and the seeds of knowledge
are implanted in every rational creature. The
mind of man is unlimited in its aspirations. “The
body is enclosed by small boundaries; the voice roams
within wider limits; the sight is bounded only by the
vault of heaven; but for the mind, neither in heaven
nor anywhere outside of heaven can a boundary be
fixed for it.”</p>

<p>Man delights in harmony; and, as respects both his
mind and his body, he is a harmony. Just as the
great world itself is like an immense piece of clockwork,
put together with many wheels and bells, and
arranged with such art that, throughout the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
structure, one part depends upon another through the
harmony and perfection of the movements—so it is
with man. All this harmony and perfection is made
possible through education.</p>

<p>He gave no bad definition, remarks Comenius, who
said that man was a “teachable animal.” But he must
be taught, since he is born only with aptitudes.
Before he can sit, stand, walk, or use his hands, he
requires instruction. It is the law of all created
things that they develop gradually and ultimately
reach a state of perfection. Plato was right when he
said, “If properly educated, man is the gentlest and
most divine of created beings; but if left uneducated
or subjected to a false training, he is the most
intractable thing in the world.”</p>

<p>Education is necessary for all classes of society;
and this is the more apparent when we consider the
marked individual differences to be found among
human beings. No one doubts that the stupid need
instruction that they may outgrow their stupidity.
But clever and precocious minds require more careful
instruction than dull and backward minds; since those
who are mentally active, if not occupied with useful
things, will busy themselves with what is useless, curious,
and pernicious. Just as a millstone grinds itself
away with noise if wheat is not supplied, so an active
mind, if void of serious things, entangles itself with
vain, curious, and noxious thoughts, and becomes the
cause of its own destruction.</p>

<p>The time for education is in early youth.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> God has,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
accordingly, made the years of childhood unsuitable
for anything but education; and this matter was
interposed by the deliberate intent of a wise Providence.
Youth is a period of great plasticity. It is
in the nature of everything that comes into being to
bend and form easily while tender; but when the
plastic period has passed to alter only with great difficulty.
If one wishes to become a good tailor, writer,
or musician, he must apply himself to his art from
his earliest youth, during the period when his
imagination is most active and when his fingers are
most flexible. Only during the years of childhood is
it possible to train the muscles to do skilled work. If,
then, parents have the welfare of their children at
heart, and if the good of the human race be dear to
the civil and ecclesiastical guardians of society, let
them hasten to make provision for the timely planting,
pruning, and watering of the plants of heaven
that these may be prudently formed in letters, virtue,
and piety.</p>

<p>Private education is not desirable. Children should
be trained in common, since better results and more
pleasures are to be obtained when they are taught
together in classes. Not only is class teaching a
saving of labor over private instruction, but it introduces
a rivalry that is both needful and helpful.
Moreover, young children learn much that is useful
by imitation through association with school-fellows.
Comenius, it may be remarked, was one of the first
of the educational reformers to see clearly the value
of class teaching and graded instruction. His reforms
in this direction have already been noted.</p>

<p>School training is necessary for the children of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
grades of society, not of the rich and powerful only,
but the poor and lowly as well. Let none be neglected,
unless God has denied him sense and intelligence.
When it is urged that the laboring classes need no
school education, let it be also recalled that they are
expected to think, obey, and do good.</p>

<p>Girls should be educated as well as boys. No satisfactory
reason can be given why women should be
excluded from the pursuits of knowledge, whether in
the Latin or in the mother-tongue. They are formed
in the image of God as well as men; and they are
endowed with equal sharpness of mind and capacity
for learning, often, indeed, with more than the opposite
sex. Why, then, should we admit them to the
alphabet, and afterwards drive them away from books?
Comenius takes issue with most writers on education
that study will make women blue-stockings and chatterboxes.
On the contrary, he maintains, the more
their minds are occupied with the fruits of learning,
the less room and temptation there will be for gossip
and folly.</p>

<p>Not only should education be common to all classes
of society, but the subjects of instruction should be
common to the whole range of knowledge. Comenius
holds that it is the business of educators to take
strong and vigorous measures that no man in his
journey through life may encounter anything so unknown
to him that he will be unable to pass sound
judgment upon it and turn it to its proper use without
serious error. This desire for encyclopædic learning,
as already noted, dominated his life and writings.</p>

<p>But even Comenius recognized the futility of
thoroughness in a wide range of instruction, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
expresses willingness to be satisfied if men know the
principles, the causes, and the uses of all things in
existence. It is general culture—something about a
great many things—that he demands.</p>

<p>Comenius clearly saw that the conditions of educational
institutions were wholly inadequate for the
realization of these purposes—(1) because of an
insufficient number of schools, and (2) because of the
unscientific character of current methods of instruction.
The exhortations of Martin Luther, he observes,
remedied the former shortcoming, but it remains for
the future to improve the latter.</p>

<p>The best intellects are ruined by unsympathetic and
unpedagogic methods. Such great severity characterizes
the schools that they are looked upon as terrors
for the boys and shambles for their intellects. Most
of the students contract a dislike for learning, and
many leave school altogether. The few who are forced
by parents and guardians to remain acquire a most
preposterous and wretched sort of education, so that
instead of tractable lambs, the schools produce wild
asses and restive mules. Nothing could be more
wretched than the discipline of the schools. “What
should be gently instilled into the intellect is violently
impressed upon it, nay, rather flogged into it. How
many, indeed, leave the schools and universities with
scarcely a notion of true learning.” Comenius laments
that he and many thousands of his contemporaries
have miserably lost the sweet spring-time of life and
wasted the fresh years of youth on scholastic trifles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span></p>


<h3><i>Education according to Nature</i></h3>

<p>Comenius proposes to so reconstruct systems of
education that (1) all shall be educated, except those
to whom God has denied understanding, in all those
subjects calculated to make men wise, virtuous, and
pious; (2) the course of training, being a preparation
for life, shall be completed before maturity is attained;
(3) and schools shall be conducted without blows,
gently and pleasantly, in the most natural manner.
Bold innovator! How clearly he perceived the faults
of the schools of his day; with what keen insight he
formulated methods for their improvement; and with
what hope in the reform which has gone forward
steadily for these two hundred and seventy-five years,
but which even now is far from being an accomplished
fact!</p>

<p>The basis of the reform which he advocates is an
application of the principle of order—order in the
management of time, in the arrangement of subjects
taught, and in the methods employed. Nature furnishes
us a criterion for order in all matters pertaining
to the improvement of human society. Certain
universal principles, which are fundamental to his
philosophy of education, are deduced from nature.
These, stripped of their tedious examples and details,
are:—</p>

<p>1. Nature observes a suitable time.</p>

<p>2. She prepares the material before she attempts to
give it form.</p>

<p>3. She chooses a fit subject to act upon, or first
submits her subject to a suitable treatment in order to
make it fit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span></p>

<p>4. She is not confused in her operations; but, in
her onward march, advances with precision from one
point to another.</p>

<p>5. In all the operations of nature, development is
from within.</p>

<p>6. In her formative processes, she begins with the
universal and ends with the particular.</p>

<p>7. Nature makes no leaps, but proceeds step by
step.</p>

<p>8. When she begins a thing, she does not leave off
until the operation is completed.</p>

<p>9. She avoids all obstacles that are likely to interfere
with her operations.</p>

<p>With nature as our guide, Comenius believes that
the process of education will be easy, (1) if it is begun
before the mind is corrupted; (2) if the mind is prepared
to receive it; (3) if we proceed from the general
to the particular, from what is easy to what is more
complex; (4) if the pupils are not overburdened with
too many different studies; (5) if the instruction is
graded to the stages of the mental development of the
learners; (6) if the interests of the children are consulted
and their intellects are not forced along lines
for which they have no natural bent; (7) if everything
is taught through the medium of the senses; (8) if the
utility of instruction is emphasized; and (9) if everything
is taught by one and the same method.</p>

<p>Nature begins by a careful selection of materials,
therefore education should commence early; the pupils
should not have more than one teacher in each subject,
and before anything else is done, the morals should be
rendered harmonious by the teacher’s influence.</p>

<p>Nature always makes preparation for each advance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
step; therefore, the desire to know and to learn should
be excited in children in every way possible, and the
method of instruction should lighten the drudgery,
that there may be nothing to hinder progress in school
studies.</p>

<p>Nature develops everything from beginnings which,
though insignificant in appearance, possess great potential
strength; whereas, the practice of most teachers is
in direct opposition to this principle. Instead of starting
with fundamental facts, they begin with a chaos
of diverse conclusions.</p>

<p>Nature advances from what is easy to what is more
difficult. It is, therefore, wrong to teach the unknown
through the medium of that which is equally unknown.
Such errors may be avoided if pupils and teachers talk
in the same language and explanations are given in the
language that the pupil understands; if grammars and
dictionaries are adapted in the language and to the
understanding of the pupils; if, in the study of a
foreign language, the pupils first learn to understand
it, then to write it, and lastly to speak it; if in such
study the pupils get to know first that which is nearest
to their mental vision, then that which lies moderately
near, then that which is more remote, and lastly that
which is farthest off; and if children be made to exercise
first their senses, then their memory, and finally
their understanding.</p>

<p>Nature does not overburden herself, but is content
with a little at a time; therefore the mental energies
of the pupils should not be dissipated over a wide
range of subject-matter.</p>

<p>Nature advances slowly; therefore school sessions
should be shortened to four hours; pupils should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
forced to memorize as little as possible; school instruction
should be graded to the ages and capacities of the
children.</p>

<p>Nature compels nothing to advance that is not driven
forward by its own mature strength; therefore it follows
that nothing should be taught to children not
demanded by their age, interests, and mental ability.</p>

<p>Nature assists her operations in every possible
manner; therefore children should not be punished
for inability to learn. Rather, instruction should be
given through the senses that it may be retained in
the memory with less effort.</p>

<p>Nothing is produced by nature the practical application
of which is not evident; therefore those things
only should be taught whose application can be easily
demonstrated.</p>

<p>Nature is uniform in all her operations; hence the
same method of instruction should be adapted to all
subjects of study, and the text-books in each subject
should, as far as possible, be of the same editions.</p>

<p>Comenius observes that there is a very general complaint
that few leave school with a thorough education,
and that most of the instruction retained in after life
is little more than a mere shadow of true knowledge.
He considers that the complaint is well corroborated
by facts, and attributes the cause to the insignificant
and unimportant studies with which the schools occupy
themselves. If we would correct this evil, we must go
to the school of nature and investigate the methods
she adopts to give endurance to the beings which she
has created.</p>

<p>A method should be found by means of which each
person will be able not only to bring into his mental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
consciousness that which he has learned, but at the
same time to pass sound judgment on the objective
facts to which his information refers. This will be
possible if only those subjects are studied which will
be of real service in the later life; if such subjects be
taught without digression or interruption; if a thorough
grounding precede the detailed instruction; if all
that comes later be based upon what has gone before;
if great stress be laid on the points of resemblance
between cognate subjects; if the studies be arranged
with reference to the pupils’ present mental development,
and if knowledge be fixed in the memory by
constant use.</p>

<p>In support of his principle of thoroughness, Comenius
adduces the following proofs from nature: Nothing
is produced by nature that is useless. When she
forms a body, she omits nothing that is necessary.
She does not operate on anything unless it possesses
foundations, and she strikes her roots deep and develops
everything from them. She never remains at
rest, but advances continually; never begins anything
fresh at the expense of work already begun, but proceeds
with what she has started and brings it to completion.
She knits everything together in continuous
combination, preserving due proportion with respect
to both quality and quantity. Through constant exercise
she becomes strong and fruitful.</p>

<p>Progress is less a question of strength than of skill.
Hitherto little has been accomplished in the school-life
of the child, because no set landmarks have been
set up as goals to be reached by the pupils; things
naturally associated are not taught together; the arts
and sciences are scarcely ever thought of as an encyclo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>pædic
whole; the methods employed are as numerous
and diverse as the schools and teachers; instruction is
individual and private, and not public and general, and
books are selected with too little regard for the value
of their contents. If these matters could be reformed,
there is no doubt in the mind of Comenius that the
whole circle of the sciences might be covered during
the period of school training. Toward the solution of
this problem he answers the following questions:—</p>

<p>1. How can a single teacher instruct a large number
of children at the same time? In answer, he
maintains that it is not only possible for one teacher
to instruct several hundred children (!) at once, but
that it is essential for the best interests of both the
teacher and the children (!!). The larger the number
of pupils, the greater will be the teacher’s interest in
his work; and the keener his interest, the greater the
enthusiasm of his pupils. In the same way, to the
children, the presence of a number of companions will
be productive not only of utility, but also of enjoyment,
since they will mutually stimulate and assist
one another. For children of this age, emulation and
rivalry are the best incentives to study. The reader
will observe that this scheme of Comenius contemplates
some adaptation of the system of pupil teaching,
and that it interdicts all efforts at individual
instruction.</p>

<p>2. How far is it possible for pupils to be taught
from the same book? It is an undisputed fact, says
Comenius, that too many facts presented to the mind
at the same time distract the attention. It will, therefore,
be of great advantage if the pupils be permitted
to use no books except those which have been expressly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
composed for the class in which they are. Such books
should contain a complete, thorough, and accurate epitome
of all the subjects of instruction. They should give
a true representation of the entire universe; should be
written simply and clearly—preferably in the form of
a dialogue; and should give the pupils sufficient assistance
to enable them, if necessary, to pursue their
studies without the help of a master.</p>

<p>3. How is it possible for all the pupils in a school
to do the same thing at one time? This may be accomplished
by having a course of instruction commence
at a definite time of each year; and by and by so
dividing the course of instruction that each year, each
month, each week, each day, each hour may have a
definite appointed task for it.</p>

<p>4. How is it possible to teach everything according
to one and the same method? That there is only
one natural method has already been satisfactorily
demonstrated (to the mind of Comenius), and the universal
adoption of this natural method will be as great
a boon to pupils as a plain and undeviating road is to
travellers.</p>

<p>5. How can many things be explained in a few
words? The purpose of education is not to fill the
mind with a dreary waste of words from books.
Rightly says Seneca of instruction: “Its administration
should resemble the sowing of seed, in which
stress is laid not on the quantity, but on the quality.”</p>

<p>6. How is it possible to do two or three things by
a single operation? It may be laid down as a general
rule that each subject should be taught in combination
with those which are correlative to it. Reading, penmanship,
spelling, language, and nature study should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
work together in the acquisition and expression of
ideas. As Professor Hanus<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> has pointed out,
Comenius clearly foreshadowed the correlation and
coördination of school studies at least two centuries
before Herbart. Indeed, he went so far as to urge the
correlation of school instruction with the plays and
games of children. He urged that children be given
tools and allowed to imitate the different handicrafts,
by playing at farming, at politics, at being soldiers
or architects. In the game of war they may be allowed
to take the part of field-marshals, generals, captains,
and standard-bearers. In that of politics they may be
kings, ministers, chancellors, secretaries, and ambassadors,
as well as senators, consuls, and lawyers; since
such pleasantries often lead to serious things. Thus,
maintains Comenius, would be fulfilled Luther’s wish
that the studies of the young at school might be so
organized that the pupils would take as much pleasure
in them as playing at ball all day. In this way, the
schools might become a real prelude to the more
serious duties of practical life.</p>


<h3><i>Methods of Instruction</i></h3>

<p>A correct method of instruction was to Comenius, as
has already been pointed out, the panacea for most of
the ills of teaching. He made reform in methodology
the starting point of all his schemes for educational
improvement. In the <i>Great didactic</i> he considers
reform in methods of instructing in the sciences, arts,
language, morals, and religion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span></p>

<p>1. <i>Science.</i> Knowledge of nature or science requires
objects to be perceived and sufficient attention for the
perception of the objects. The youth who would comprehend
the sciences must observe four rules: (1) he
must keep the eye of his mind pure; (2) he must see
that the proper relationship is established between
the eye and the object; (3) he must attend to the object;
(4) he must proceed from one object to another in
accordance with a suitable method.</p>

<p>The beginning of wisdom in the sciences consists,
not in the mere learning of the names of things, but in
the actual perception of the things themselves. It is
after the thing has been grasped by the senses that
language should fulfil its function of still further
explaining it. The senses are the trusty servants of
the memory, leading to the permanent retention of
the knowledge that has been acquired. Reasoning,
also, is conditioned and mediated by the experience
gained through sense-perception. It is evident, therefore,
that if we wish to develop a true love and
knowledge of science, we must take special care to
see that everything is learned by actual observation
through sense-perception. This should be the golden
rule of teachers: Everything should as far as possible
be placed before the senses.</p>

<p>When the objects themselves cannot be procured,
representations of them may be used; models may be
constructed or the objects may be represented by
means of engravings. This is especially needful in
such studies as geography, geometry, botany, zoölogy,
physiology, and physics. It requires both labor and
expense to produce models, but the results of such aids
will more than repay the efforts. In the absence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
both objects and models, the things may be represented
by means of pictures.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></p>

<p>2. <i>Arts.</i> “Theory,” says Vives, “is easy and short,
but has no result other than the gratification that it
affords. Practice, on the other hand, is difficult and
prolix, but of immense utility.” Since this is so,
remarks Comenius, we should diligently seek out a
method by which the young may be easily led to
the application of such natural forces as one finds in
the arts.</p>

<p>In the acquisition of an art, three things are required:
(1) a model which the pupil may examine and then
try to imitate; (2) material on which the new form is
to be impressed; and (3) instruments by the aid of
which the work is accomplished. After these have
been provided, three things more are necessary before
an art can be learned—a proper use of the materials,
skilled guidance, and frequent practice.</p>

<p>Progress in the art studies is primarily through
practice. Let the pupils learn to write by writing, to
talk by talking, and to sing by singing. Since imitation
is such an important factor in the mastery of an
art, it is sheer cruelty to try to force a pupil to do that
which you wish done, while the pupil is ignorant of
your wishes. The use of instruments should be shown
in practice, and not by words; by example, rather than
by precept. It is many years since Quintilian wrote,
“Through precepts the way is long and difficult, while
through examples it is short and practicable.” But
alas! remarks Comenius, how little heed the schools
pay to this advice. Man is essentially an imitative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
animal, and it is by imitation that children learn to
walk, to run, to talk, and to play.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> Rules are like
thorns to the understanding, since to grasp them
requires a degree of mental development not common
during the elementary school life of the child.</p>

<p>Comenius would have the first attempts at imitation
as accurate as possible, since whatever comes first
is the foundation of that which is to follow. All
haste in the first steps should be avoided, lest we proceed
to the advanced work before the elements have
been mastered.</p>

<p>Perfect instruction in the arts is based on both
synthesis and analysis. The synthetic steps should
generally come first, since we should commence with
what is easy, and our own efforts are always easiest to
understand. But the accurate analysis of the work of
others must not be neglected. Finally, it must be
remembered that it is practice, nothing but faithful
practice, that makes an artist.</p>

<p>3. <i>Language.</i> We learn languages, not merely for
the erudition and wisdom which they hold, but because
languages are the instruments by which we acquire
knowledge and by which we impart our knowledge to
others. The study of languages, particularly in youth,
should be joined to the study of objects. The intelligence
should thus be exercised on matters which appeal
to the interests and comprehension of children. They
waste their time who place before children Cicero and
the other great writers; for, if students do not understand
the subject-matter, how can they master the
various devices for expressing it forcibly? The time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
would be more usefully spent on less ambitious efforts,
so correlated that the languages and the general intelligence
might advance together step by step. Nature
makes no leaps, neither does art, since art imitates
nature.</p>

<p>Each language should be learned separately. First
of all, the mother-tongue should be learned; then a
modern language—that of a neighboring nation;
after this, Latin; and, lastly, Greek and Hebrew. The
mother-tongue, because of its intimate connection with
the gradual unfolding of the objective world to the
senses, will require from eight to ten years; a modern
language may be mastered in one year; Latin in two
years; Greek in one year; and Hebrew in six months.</p>

<p>There are four stages in the study of a language.
The first is the age of babbling infancy, during which
time language is indistinctly spoken; the second is the
age of ripening boyhood, in which the language is
correctly spoken; the third is the age of mature
youth, in which the language is elegantly spoken; and
the fourth is the age of vigorous manhood, in which
the language is forcibly spoken.</p>

<p>4. <i>Morals.</i> If the schools are to become forging
places of humanity, the art of moral instruction must
be more definitely elaborated. To this end Comenius
formulates the following pedagogic rules:—</p>

<p>All the virtues may be implanted in men.</p>

<p>Those virtues which are called cardinal virtues—prudence,
temperance, fortitude, and justice—should
first be implanted.</p>

<p>Prudence may be acquired through good instruction,
and by learning the differences which exist between
things and the relative value of those things. Come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>nius
expresses agreement with Vives, that sound judgment
must be acquired in early youth.</p>

<p>Children should be taught to observe temperance in
eating, drinking, sleeping, exercising, and playing.</p>

<p>Fortitude is to be learned by the suppression of excessive
desires—playing at the wrong time or beyond
the proper time—and by avoiding manifestations of
anger, discontent, and impatience. It is needful for
the young to learn fortitude in the matter of frankness
and endurance in toil. Children must be taught to
work, and moral education must preach the gospel of
work.</p>

<p>Lastly, examples of well-ordered lives in the persons
of parents, teachers, nurses, and schoolmates must
continually be set before the children, and they must
be carefully guarded against bad associations.</p>

<p>5. <i>Religion.</i> In the scheme of education which
Comenius outlines in the <i>Great didactic</i>, religion
occupies the most exalted place; and while training
in morals is accessory to religion, children must in
addition be given specific instruction in piety. For
this purpose definite methods of instruction are outlined.
Instruction in piety must be of such a
character as to lead children to follow God, by giving
themselves completely up to His will, by acquiescing
in His love, and by singing His praises. The child’s
heart may thus be joined to His in love through
meditation, prayer, and examination. Children should
early be habituated to the outward works which He
commands, that they may be trained to express their
faith by works. At first they will not understand the
true nature of what they are doing, since their intelligence
is not yet sufficiently developed; but it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
important that they learn to do what subsequent
experience will teach them to be right.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></p>

<p>While Comenius was not willing to go as far as St.
Augustine and the early church fathers in the matter
of abolishing altogether the whole body of pagan
literature from the school, nevertheless, he thought
that the best interests of the religious education of
the child required unusual precaution in the reading of
pagan books. He reminds his readers that it is the
business of Christian schools to form citizens, not
merely for this world, but also for heaven, and that
accordingly children should read mainly those authors
who are well acquainted with heavenly as well as
with earthly things.</p>


<h3><i>Types of Educational Institutions</i></h3>

<p>The modern fourfold division of education into
kindergarten, elementary schools, secondary schools,
colleges or universities was clearly foreshadowed by
Comenius in the <i>Great didactic</i>. His philosophy of
education comprehends a school of infancy, a school
of the mother-tongue, a Latin school, and a university.
These different institutions, he notes, are not merely
to deal with different subjects, but they are to treat
the same subjects in different ways, giving such
instruction in all of them as will make true men,
true Christians, and true scholars, although grading
the instruction throughout to the age, capabilities,
and previous training of the learners.</p>

<p>1. <i>School of infancy.</i> Comenius would have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
mother’s school in every home, where children may
be given such training as will fit them at the age of
six years to begin regular studies in the vernacular
school. He prepared for the use of mothers during
this period a detailed outline, which he published
under the title, <i>Information for mothers, or School of
infancy</i>. An analysis of this book is given in the
following chapter on the earliest training of the child.</p>

<p>2. <i>School of the mother-tongue.</i> This covers the
years from six to twelve, and includes all children of
both sexes. The aim of this school is to teach the
young such things as will be of practical utility in later
life—to read with ease both printing and writing in
the mother-tongue; to write first with accuracy, and
finally with confidence in accordance with the rules of
the mother-tongue; to compute numbers as far as may
be necessary for practical purposes; to measure spaces,
such as lengths, breadths and distances; to sing well-known
melodies, and to learn by heart the greater
number of psalms and hymns commonly used in the
country. In addition, the children study the principles
of morality, the general history of the world, the
geography of the earth and principal kingdoms of
Europe, elementary economics and politics, and the
rudiments of the mechanical arts.</p>

<p>The six years of the school of the mother-tongue
are graded into six classes, with a detailed course
of study for each class. Provision is made for four
lessons daily, two in the forenoon and two in the
afternoon. The remaining hours of the day are to be
spent in domestic work or in some form of recreation.
The morning hours are devoted to such studies as
train the intellect; the afternoons to such as give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
manual skill. No new work is to be introduced in
the afternoon; but the pupils may review and discuss
the lessons developed during the morning sessions.
If it is desired that a foreign language be introduced,
it should not be begun before the tenth year.</p>

<p>3. <i>The Latin school.</i> The purpose of the Latin
school is to give a more thorough and comprehensive
training to those aspiring to callings higher than the
industrial pursuits. It covers the years from twelve
to eighteen, and was also divided into six classes,—the
grammar, natural philosophy, mathematical, ethics,
dialectic, and rhetorical classes. Since Comenius’
views on Latin are so fully set forth in a later chapter
on language teaching and the <i>Janua</i>, it is only necessary
here to recall that his curriculum for the Latin
school includes a wide range of culture subjects. The
most important of the culture studies of the Latin
school is history, including an epitome of Biblical
history, natural history, the history of arts, inventions
and customs, history of morals, and a general historical
survey of the leading modern nations of the world.</p>

<p>4. <i>University.</i> While Comenius frankly admits
that his experience has been chiefly limited to work
in elementary and secondary schools, still he sees no
reason why he should not state his views and wishes
with regard to superior instruction. The curriculum
of the university conceived in the <i>Great didactic</i> is
universal in character, making provision for a wide
range of studies in every branch of human knowledge.
The university must possess learned and able professors
in the languages, sciences, and arts, as well as a
library of well-selected books for the common use of
all. One of the fundamental aims of the university<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
is to widen the domain of knowledge through original
investigation; in consequence, its equipment must fit
it for research work.</p>

<p>How fully these schemes have been realized, the
reader may appreciate by comparing the types of educational
institutions of the United States and Germany
with those of the <i>Great didactic</i>, which were outlined
by Comenius more than two centuries ago.</p>


<h3><i>School Discipline</i></h3>

<p>The <i>Great didactic</i> is an eloquent protest against
the severe and inhuman discipline of Comenius’ day.
Schools which abound with shrieks and blows, he says,
are not well disciplined. Discipline is quite another
thing; it is an unfailing method by which we may
make our pupils pupils in reality. This makes it
necessary for the teacher to know the child, the being
to be disciplined, the subjects of study which serve as
mental stimulants, and the relations which should
exist between the child and the subjects to be taught.</p>

<p>Discipline must be free from personal elements, such
as anger or dislike, and should be exercised with frankness
and sincerity. Teachers should administer punishments
just as physicians prescribe medicines—with
a view to improving the condition of the individual.
Nor should severe forms of discipline be
exercised in connection with studies or literary exercises.
Studies, if they are properly taught, form in
themselves a sufficient attraction. When this is not
the case, the fault lies not with the pupil, but with the
teacher; if his skill is unable to make an impression
on the understanding, his blows will have no effect.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
Indeed, he is more likely to produce a distaste for
letters than a love for them by the application of force.</p>

<p>Whenever, therefore, we see a mind that is diseased
or dislikes study, we should try to remove its disposition
by gentle remedies; but on no account should we
employ violent ones. The sun gives us an excellent lesson
on this point. In the spring-time, when the plants
are young and tender, it does not scorch them, but warms
and invigorates them; it does not put forth its full
heat until they are full grown. The gardener proceeds
on the same principle, and does not apply the pruning
knife to plants that are immature. In the same way
the musician does not strike his instrument a blow
with his fist or throw it against the wall because it
produces a discordant sound; but setting to work on
scientific principles, he tunes it and gets it into order.
Just such a skilful and sympathetic treatment is
necessary to instil a love of learning into the minds
of pupils; and any other procedure will only convert
their idleness into antipathy and their interest into
downright stupidity.</p>

<p>Severe forms of discipline should be used only in
cases of moral delinquencies, as (1) impiety of any
kind, such as blasphemy, obscenity, and other offences
against God’s law; (2) stubbornness and premeditated
misbehavior, such as disobeying orders and conscious
neglect of duty; and (3) pride, disdain, envy, and idleness.
Offences of the first kind are an insult against
the majesty of God; those of the second kind undermine
the foundations of virtue; and those of the third
prevent any rapid progress in studies. An offence
against God is a crime, and should be expiated by an
extremely severe punishment; an offence against man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
is iniquitous, and should be promptly corrected; but
an offence against Priscian is a stain that may be
wiped out by the sponge of blame. In a word, the
object of discipline should be to stir the pupils to
revere God, to assist their fellows, and to perform the
labors and duties of life with alacrity.</p>

<h3><i>The School of Infancy</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Plato</span>, Quintilian, Plutarch, and other writers on
education have discussed the earliest training of the
child, but none of these early writers have comprehended
the significance of infancy with any such pedagogic
insight as Comenius; and his <i>School of infancy</i>
has taken a permanent place among the classics which
deal with the period of childhood. It was written
during the years 1628 to 1630, when he was in charge
of the Moravian school at Lissa. A German edition
(it was originally written in the Sclavic tongue) appeared
at Lissa in 1633, a second edition at Leipzig
in 1634, and a third German edition at Nuremberg
in 1636. Subsequently Polish, Bohemian, and Latin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
translations appeared; and Joseph Müller,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> a most
painstaking Comenius bibliographer, mentions an English
translation in 1641. I have found no other reference
to an English translation so early. As already
noted, however, Comenius was well and favorably
known to Milton, Hartlib, and others high in educational
authority in England; and the fact that most
of his other writings were translated there gives credence
to Mr. Müller’s statement. In the year 1858,
Mr. Daniel Benham<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> published in London an English
translation, to which he prefixed a well-written account
of the life of Comenius. But his translation was soon
out of print; and this excellent treatise in consequence
remained inaccessible to English readers until
the appearance of my own translation. (Boston, 1896.
Republished in London, 1897.)</p>

<p>The <i>School of infancy</i> was written as a guide for
mothers during the first six years of the child’s life,
and was dedicated to “pious Christian parents, guardians,
teachers, and all upon whom the charge of children
is incumbent.” Since the education of the child
must begin at its birth, mothers must assume the
teacher’s rôle; and the mothers of the seventeenth century,
according to Comenius, were altogether unfitted
because of lack of training to undertake this high and
holy mission. Accordingly, the <i>School of infancy</i> outlines
definite instructions for mothers.</p>

<p>Comenius was too deeply grounded in the religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
dogmas of his day to abandon altogether the doctrine
of original sin, then so generally held; but he maintained
that suitable early training would overcome
most of the original perversity in the human heart.
No one, he urges, should be a mother or a teacher who
does not hold unbounded faith in the possibilities of
childhood. The child is not to be regarded with reference
to its youthful disabilities, but rather with a
view to the purposes of the Divine mind, as Fröbel
would say, regard the child as a pledge of the presence,
goodness, and love of God. What higher tribute
to childhood than this: “The mother that has under
her care the training of a little child possesses a garden
in which celestial plantlets are sown, watered, bloom,
and flourish. How inexpressibly blessed is a mother
in such a paradise!” With Quintilian he asks: “Has
a son been born to you? From the first, conceive only
the highest hopes for him.”</p>

<p>The purpose in the education of the child is threefold:
(1) faith and piety, (2) uprightness in respect to
morals, and (3) knowledge of languages and arts; and
this order must not be inverted. Parents, therefore,
do not fully perform their duty when they merely
teach their offspring to eat, drink, walk, and talk.
These things are merely subservient to the body,
which is not the man, but his tabernacle only; the
rational soul dwells within, and rightly claims greater
care than its outward tenement.</p>

<p>In the education of the child, care especially for
the soul, which is the highest part of its nature; and
next, attend to the body, that it may be made a fit
and worthy habitation for the soul. Aim to train the
child to a clear and true knowledge of God and all his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
wonderful works, and a knowledge of himself, so that
he may wisely and prudently regulate his actions.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind, however, that to properly
train children requires clear insight and assiduous
labor. It is to be regretted that so many parents are
too incompetent to instruct their children and that
others, by reason of the performance of family and
social duties, are unable to discharge this high and
holy mission. All such, of course, must hand their
children over to some one else to instruct. But they
should intrust their little ones to the care and training
of such instructors only who will make the act of
learning pleasing and agreeable—a mere amusement
and mental delight.</p>

<p>Schools should be retreats of ease, places of literary
amusement, and not houses of torture. A musician
does not dash his instrument against the wall, or give
it blows and cuffs because he cannot draw music from
it, but continues to apply his skill until he is able to
extract a melody. So by your skill you should bring
the mind of the young child into harmony with his
studies.</p>

<p>The first step in the education of the child is the
most important. Every one knows that whatever
form the branches of an old tree may have, that they
must necessarily have been so formed from the first
growth. The animal born blind, lame, defective, or
deformed remains so. The training of the child’s
body, mind, and soul should, therefore, be a matter
of earnest thought from the very first.</p>

<p>While it is possible for God to completely transform
an inveterately bad man, yet, in the regular course of
nature, it scarcely ever happens otherwise than that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
as a being is formed during the early stages of development,
so it matures, and so it remains. Whatever
seed is sown in youth, such fruit is reaped in old age.</p>

<p>Nor is it wise to delay such training until the child
is old enough to be instructed in a school, since tendencies
are acquired which are difficult to overcome.
It is impossible to make a tree straight that has grown
crooked, or to produce an orchard from a forest everywhere
surrounded with briers and thorns. This makes
it necessary for parents to know something about the
management of children, that they may be able to
lay the foundations upon which the teachers are to
build when the child enters school at the age of six
years.</p>

<p>Great care must be exercised with reference to the
methods adopted with children so young. The instruction
need not be apportioned to the same degree that
it is apportioned in schools, since at this early age all
children are not endowed with equal ability, some
beginning to speak in the first year, some in the
second, and some not until the third year.</p>


<h3><i>Physical Training</i></h3>

<p>The first care of the mother must be for the health
of her child, since bodily vigor so largely conditions
normal mental development. “A certain author,”
says Comenius, “advises that parents ought ‘to pray
for a sound mind in a sound body,’ but they ought to
labor as well as pray.” Since the early care of the
child devolves largely on the mother, Comenius counsels
women with reference to the hygiene of childhood.
Prenatal conditions are no less important than post<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>natal;
and prospective mothers should observe temperance
in diet, avoid violent movements, control the
emotions, and indulge in no excessive sleep or indolence.</p>

<p>For good and sufficient reasons the mother should
nurse her own child. “How grievous, how hurtful,
how reprehensible,” he exclaims, “is the conduct of
some mothers, especially among the upper classes, who,
feeling it irksome to nourish their own offspring, delegate
the duty to other women.” This cruel alienation
of mothers from their children, he maintains, is the
greatest obstacle to the early training of the child.
Such conduct is clearly opposed to nature: the wolf
and bear, the lion and panther, nourish their offspring
with their own milk; and shall the mothers of the
human race be less affectionate than the wild beasts?
Moreover, it contributes to the health of the child to
be nourished by its natural mother.</p>

<p>Comenius has some sound advice for mothers on the
kinds of food for young children. At the first it must
as nearly as possible approximate to their natural aliment;
it must be soft, sweet, and easily digestible.
Milk is an excellent food; and after milk, bread,
butter, and vegetables. All highly seasoned foods are
to be avoided; and Comenius urges mothers to regard
medicines as they would poisons, and avoid them
altogether. Children accustomed to medicine from
their earliest years are certain to become “feeble,
sickly, infirm, pale-faced, imbecile, cancerous.”</p>

<p>Children during the earliest years require an abundance
of sleep, fresh air, and exercise. They need not
only to be exercised, but their exercises should be in
the nature of amusements. “A joyful mind,” he
remarks, “is half health, and the joy of the heart is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
the very life-spring of the child.” These exercises for
the amusement of the child may provide for the pleasure
of its eyes, ears, and other senses, as well as contribute
to the vigor of its body and mind. Play not
only conduces to the health of the child, but it lays the
basis for later development.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>


<h3><i>Mental Training</i></h3>

<p>For the mental training of the child during its first
six years Comenius has outlined two classes of studies:
(1) those which furnish the materials of thought, such
as nature study, geography, and household economy,
and (2) those which furnish the symbols of thought,
such as drawing, writing, and language. This grouping
of form and content studies, it should be noted,
has been followed by the disciples of Herbart in their
schemes of classification.</p>

<p>The first and second years of the child’s life must
be entirely given over to the development of organic
functions; but, by the beginning of the third year, the
child has acquired a vocabulary, and he should be
taught to comprehend the meaning of the words he
uses. This early knowledge should be of natural
things—plants, flowers, trees, sand, clay, the cow,
horse, and dog. He may be taught to comprehend
some of the more important observable characters of
these objects and to know their uses.</p>

<p>Special exercises should be provided for the training<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
of the eye; excessive lights must be avoided, and also
overstraining. Children may be moderately introduced
to objects of color, and thus taught to enjoy the
beauty of the heavens, trees, flowers, and running
water. In the fourth and following years they should
be taken into fields and along the rivers, and trained to
observe plants, animals, running water, and the turning
of windmills. In both nature study and geography
Comenius anticipated the <i>Heimatskunde</i> of Pestalozzi.</p>

<p>Children should also during their first six years be
taught to know the heavens, and to distinguish between
sun, moon, and stars; to understand that the sun and
moon rise and set; to recognize that the days are
shortest in winter and longest in  summer; to distinguish
time—morning, noonday, evening, and when to
eat, sleep, and pray.</p>

<p>The study of geography should be begun at the
cradle, and the location, distance, and direction of the
nursery, kitchen, bed-chamber, and orchard should
early be learned. They should have out-door lessons
in geography, and be taught to find their way through
the streets, to the market-place, and to the homes of
their friends and relatives. In the fifth year they
should study a city, field, orchard, forest, hill, and
river, and fix what they learn about these things in
the memory.</p>

<p>The early historic instruction should begin with a
development of the sense of time—the working days
and the Sabbath days, when to attend and engage in
divine services, the occurrence of such solemn festivals
as Christmas, Easter, and Whitsuntide, and the significance
of these holy occasions. The child may also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
be trained to recall where he was and what he did
yesterday, the day before, a week ago.</p>

<p>Household economy should receive important instruction
during the first six years of the child’s life.
He must be trained to know the relation which he is
to sustain to his father and mother, and to obey each;
where to place and how to care for his clothes; the
use of toys and playthings; the economy of the home,
and his place in that economy.</p>

<p>Comenius also commends stories and fables, particularly
those about animals which contain some moral
principle. “Stories,” says Comenius, “greatly sharpen
the innate capacity of children.” Ingeniously constructed
stories serve a twofold purpose in the early
development of the child: they occupy their minds,
and they instil knowledge which will afterward be of
use.</p>

<p>The greatest service which parents can render their
children during these early years is to encourage play.
This must not be left to chance, but must be provided
for; and children need, most of all, to play with other
children near their own age. In such social plays with
their companions there is neither the assumption of
authority nor the dread of fear, but the free intercourse
which calls forth all their powers of invention,
sharpens their wits, and cultivates their manners and
habits.</p>

<p>In his discussion of the form studies, such as drawing,
writing, and language, Comenius remarks that
nothing delights children more than to be doing something.
Youthful vigor will not long permit them to
be at rest; and this spontaneous activity requires wise
regulation, in order that children may acquire the habit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
of doing things that they will be required to do later.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a>
This is the time when children are most imaginative
and imitative; they delight in doing the things that
they have seen done by their elders. All these imitative
exercises give health to their bodies, agility to
their movements, and vigor to their muscles.</p>

<p>At this period children delight in construction; supply
them with material with which they may exercise
whatever architectural genius they may have—clay,
wood, blocks, and stones, with which to construct
houses, walls, etc. They should also have toy carriages,
houses, mills, plows, swords, and knives.
Children delight in activity, and parents should realize
that restraint is alike harmful to the development of
the mind and the body.</p>

<p>After children have been taught to walk, run, jump,
roll hoop, throw balls, and to construct with blocks and
clay, supply them with chalk or charcoal, and allow
them to draw according as their inclination may be
excited. In arithmetic Comenius recognizes the difficulty
in leading children to see quantitative relations.
By the fourth year, however, he thinks that they may
be taught to count to ten and to note resemblances
and differences in quantity. To proceed further than
this would be unprofitable, nay, hurtful, he says, since
nothing is so difficult to fix in the mind of the young
child as numbers. Comenius, it would seem, valued
the study of arithmetic much less highly than modern
educators. He thought that some geometry might be
taught during these early years; children may easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
be trained to perceive the common geometric forms;
and the measurements and comparisons involved in
the perception of such forms train the understanding
of the child.</p>

<p>Music is instinctive and natural to the child. Complaints
and wailings are his first lessons in music. It
is impossible to restrain such complaints and wails;
and even if it were possible, it would not be expedient,
since all such vocalizations exercise the muscles involved
in the production of speech, develop the chest,
and contribute to the child’s general health. Children
should hear music in their earliest infancy, that their
ears and minds may be soothed by concord and harmony.
He even countenances the banging and rattling
noises which children are fond of making, on the
ground that such noises represent legitimate steps in
the development of the child’s musical sense. Give
them horns, whistles, drums, and rattles, and allow
them to acquire perceptions of rhythm and melody.</p>

<p>In the matter of instruction in language, Comenius
had one fundamental principle—that ideas of things
must accompany or precede the words which symbolized
the things. In consequence, word training, as
such, had no place in his schemes of education. When
children begin to talk, great care must be exercised that
they articulate distinctly and correctly. The start
must always be in the mother-tongue. Comenius, it
will be recalled, was at variance with his contemporaries
in deferring instruction in Latin until the child
was twelve years old. During these early years he
believes that poetry—and especially jingles and
nursery rhymes—may be used with great profit in
aiding children to acquire language. They may not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
always understand the rhymes, but they are certain to
be pleased much more by the rhythm of verse than by
prose.</p>


<h3><i>Moral and Religious Training</i></h3>

<p>However much Comenius may have valued mental
and physical training, the fundamental aim and end
of all education he regarded as moral and religious.
The agencies which he would have employed in the
early moral training of the child are (1) a perpetual
example of virtuous conduct; (2) properly timed and
prudent instruction and exercise; and (3) well-regulated
discipline. Children are exceptionally imitative, in
consequence of which there should be great circumspection
in the home in matters of temperance, cleanliness,
neatness, truthfulness, complaisance, and respect
for superiors. While lengthened discourses and
admonitions are not expedient, prudent instruction
may often accompany examples with profit.</p>

<p>As to discipline, Comenius thinks that occasionally
there is need of chastisement in order that children
may attend to examples of virtue and admonition.
When other means of discipline have been ineffectual,
the rod may be used, but only for offences against
morals—never for stupidity. Comenius gives the
impression that children may be whipped into being
good. The influence of the ill-timed advice of Solomon
is clearly apparent here.</p>

<p>Temperance and frugality, he thinks, claim the
first place in the moral training of the child, inasmuch
as they are the foundations of health and life, and the
mother of all the virtues. Neatness and cleanliness
should be exacted from the first; so should respect of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
superiors and elders. Bold and forward children are
not generally loved. Obedience, like the plant, does
not spring up spontaneously, but requires years of
patient care and training to develop into a thing of
beauty. Truthfulness likewise is no less important;
so also justice, respect for the rights of others, benevolence,
patience, and civility.</p>

<p>And most important of the virtues to be acquired
by the young child is industry. Nothing hinders
moral growth more than indolence. Comenius agrees
with the church fathers that Satan’s best allies are
the idle. Children must not be idle. Teach them to
play, to make things, to do things, to be helpful to
themselves and useful to others.</p>

<p>Comenius exaggerated the importance of religious
training during the child’s earliest years. While
recognizing that reasoning was necessary for the best
results in religious instruction, he nevertheless overburdens
the memory with formal religious instructions.
Before the child is six years old he is to be taught the
Lord’s Prayer, the Apostles’ Creed, the Confession of
Faith, the Ten Commandments, and numerous hymns.</p>

<p>In spite of his unreasonable demands on the memory,
most of Comenius’ counsels to mothers on the religious
instruction of their little ones are sane and helpful.
The spirit of the parents, he rightly suggests, is all
important in religious instruction; outward piety is
not enough. The religious nature unfolds slowly, and
unusual patience and foresight are required in its
nurture and development.</p>

<p>All this training—physical, mental, moral, and
religious—has been preliminary to the formal training
in the school, which is to begin in the sixth or seventh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
year of the child’s life. The transition step from the
home to the school is now to be made; for just “as
little plants after they have grown up from their seed
are transplanted into orchards, for their more successful
growth, so it is expedient that children, cherished
and nurtured in the home, having acquired strength of
mind and body, should be delivered to the care of
teachers.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>STUDY OF LANGUAGE</small></h2></div>



<p class="indent f08">Dominance of Latin in the seventeenth century—Methods of study
characterized by Comenius. The <i>Janua</i>—Purpose and plan—Its
success. <i>Atrium</i> and <i>Vestibulum</i>—Their relation to the
<i>Janua</i>. The <i>Orbis pictus</i>—How conceived—Its popularity—Use
of pictures. <i>Methodus novissima</i>—Principles of language

language in education.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Recalling</span> that Latin occupied such an exalted place
in the schools of Comenius’ day, it is not at all surprising
that he gave so much attention to the study of
language. Latin absorbed practically all the energies
of the pupils, and with results that were far from
satisfactory. A historian of the period says, “Boys
and teachers were alike unhappy; great severity of
discipline was practised, and after all was done, and
all the years of youth had been spent in the study
mainly of the Latin, the results were contemptible.”</p>

<p>The study of Latin is thus characterized by Comenius:</p>

<p>1. The Latin language is taught abstractly without
a knowledge of the things which the words denote.
Words should be learned in connection with things
already known; it is false to conclude that, because
children know how to utter words, they therefore understand
them.</p>

<p>2. The second evil in the study of language is driv<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>ing
children into the manifold intricacies of grammar
from the very first. It is a blunder to plunge them
into the formal statements of grammar on their first
beginning Latin. To make matters worse, the Latin
grammar is written in Latin. How should we adults
like it, if, in the study of Arabic, we had a grammar
written in the Arabic first put into our hands?</p>

<p>3. The third evil in the study of language is the
practice of compelling children to make impossible
leaps instead of carrying them forward step by step.
We introduce them from the grammar into Virgil and
Cicero. The sublimity of poetic style is beyond the
conception of boys, and the subject-matter of Cicero’s
epistles not easy for grown men. It will be said that
the object is to place before children a perfect model
to which they may attain. It is right to aim at a
perfect model, when the aim is practicable, and if we
proceed gradually to the highest. But larger things
are with advantage postponed to lesser things; and
lesser things, if accommodated to the age of the
learners, yield greater fruits than large things. If
Cicero himself were to enter our schools and find boys
engaged with his works, Comenius believes that he
would be either amused or indignant.</p>

<p>Professor Laurie remarks that “when we bear in
mind the construction of the Latin grammars then in
use,—that of Alvarus, for example, having five hundred
rules and as many exceptions,—we cannot be
surprised at the unanimous condemnation of the then
current methods of teaching, and the almost universal
lamentation over the wasted years of youth.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span></p>


<h3><i>The Janua</i></h3>

<p>We are now to see how Comenius proposed to reform
these evils. “I planned a book,” he says, “in which
all things, the properties of things, and the actions
and passions of things should be presented, and to
each should be assigned its proper work, believing
that in one and the same book the whole connected
series of things might be surveyed historically, and
the whole fabric of things and words reduced to one
continuous context. On mentioning my purpose to
some friends, one of them directed my attention to
the Jesuit father’s <i>Janua linguarum</i>, and gave me a
copy. I leaped for joy; but on examination, I found
that it did not fulfil my plan.”</p>

<p>The <i>Janua</i> referred to by Comenius was that written
by William Bateus, an Irish Jesuit, who was spiritual
father at Salamanca, Spain. His <i>Janua</i> appeared in
Spain prior to 1605. It contained twelve hundred
short Latin sentences with accompanying Spanish
translations. The sentences were made up of common
Latin root-words, and no word was repeated. In 1615
an English-Latin edition appeared; and subsequently
editions in French, German, and Italian. The object
of Bateus in the publication of his <i>Janua</i> was to promote
the spread of Christianity by enabling the heathen
the more easily to learn to read the Latin.</p>

<p>It will thus appear that the plan of the <i>Janua linguarum
reserata</i> of Comenius, the book that was destined
to make his name known throughout the world, was
not wholly original with the Moravian reformer. The
name and to some extent the plan of the book had
been suggested by the publication of the Jesuit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span></p>

<p>The first edition of Comenius’ <i>Janua</i> appeared in
1631.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> In the numerous subsequent editions the
author made important changes and additions. In
subject-matter, the <i>Janua</i> comprehends the elements
of all the sciences and arts. There are a hundred
chapter headings with a thousand Latin sentences and
their German equivalents arranged in parallel columns.
The subjects treated cover a wide range—from the
origin of the world to the mind and its faculties. The
first chapter is an introduction, in which the reader is
saluted, and informed that learning consists in this:
to know distinctions and names of things. He is
assured that he will find explained in this little book
the whole world and the Latin language. If he should
learn four pages of it by rote, he would find his eyes
opened to all the liberal arts.</p>

<p>The second chapter treats of the creation of the
world, the third of the elements, and the fourth of the
firmament. In chapters five to thirteen inclusive, fire,
meteors, water, earth, stones, metals, trees, fruits,
herbs, and shrubs are treated. Animals occupy the
next five chapters; and man—his body, external
members, internal members, qualities and accidents of
the body, ulcers and wounds, external and internal
senses, the intellect, affections, and the will—the
eleven following chapters. Nineteen chapters are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
given to the mechanic arts. Twenty-one chapters deal
with the house and its parts, marriage, the family,
civic and state economy. Twelve chapters are assigned
to grammar, dialectics, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry,
and the other branches of knowledge, describing briefly
what they are; and ethics gets twelve chapters, a
chapter being devoted to each of the twelve virtues.
In the four succeeding chapters, games, death, burial,
and the providence of God and the angels are treated.
Chapter ninety-nine treats of the end of the world; and
in the one-hundredth chapter Comenius gives some
farewell advice, and takes leave of his reader.</p>

<p>Each chapter of the <i>Janua</i> is to be read ten times.
In the first reading there is to be an accurate translation
into the vernacular; at the second reading the
whole is to be written out, Latin and vernacular, and
the teacher is to begin conversation in the Latin
tongue. At the third reading the teacher is to read
the Latin aloud, and the pupils are to translate into the
vernacular without seeing the printed page. At the
fourth reading the grammar is to be written out and
the words parsed. Special attention is to be given to
the derivation of words at the fifth reading; the synonyms
to be explained at the sixth; and the grammatical
rules applied at the seventh. At the eighth reading
the pupils are to learn the text by heart. The ninth
reading is to be devoted to a logical analysis of the
subject-matter; and the tenth and last reading is to be
conducted by the pupils themselves. They are to
challenge one another to repeat portions of the text.</p>

<p>In this ingenious manner Comenius applies his long-cherished
pansophic theories to language teaching, the
<i>Janua</i> being an application of ideas formulated in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
<i>Great didactic</i>. It is, however, more than an application
of pansophic notions—it is an attempt to realize
his oft-enunciated educational maxim that words and
things should never be divorced, that knowledge of
the language should go hand in hand with the knowledge
of the things explained.</p>

<p>The success of the <i>Janua</i> was most unexpected, and
no one was more surprised at its sudden popularity
than Comenius himself. “That happened,” he writes,
“which I could not have imagined, namely, that this
childish book was received with universal approbation
by the learned world. This was shown me by the
number of men who wished me hearty success with
my new discovery; and by the number of translations
into foreign languages. For, not only was the book
translated into twelve European languages, since I
myself have seen these translations (Latin, Greek, Bohemian,
Polish, German, Swedish, Dutch, English,
French, Spanish, Italian, and Hungarian), but also into
the Asiatic languages—Arabic, Turkish, and Persian—and
even into the Mongolian, which is understood
by all the East Indies.”</p>

<p>The <i>Janua</i>, more than any other book that he wrote,
made Comenius’ name familiar to scholars throughout
the world, and for more than a century it was the most
popular secondary-school text-book in use. How came
this book to confer on its author such world-wide
fame? “Partly,” answers Raumer, “from the pleasure
found in the survey of the whole world, adapted both
to young and old, and at a day when no great scientific
requirements were made. Many were amused by the
motley variety of the imaginations and investigations
of the book; by its old-fashioned grammatical, didactic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
and rhetorical discussions, and its spiritual extravagances.
The greatest influence was, however, exerted
by the fundamental maxim of the book—that the
knowledge of a language, and especially of the Latin,
should go hand in hand with a knowledge of the things
explained in it.”<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></p>


<h3><i>Atrium and Vestibulum</i></h3>

<p>The <i>Janua</i> was followed in 1633 by the <i>Atrium</i>. It
contains 427 short sentences somewhat more amplified
than in the <i>Janua</i>. In the introduction the teacher
promises to initiate the pupil into the mysteries of
wisdom, the knowledge of all things, the ability to do
right always, and to speak correctly of everything,
especially in Latin, which, as a common language to
all nations, is indispensable to a complete education.
The foundation of things is laid in the <i>Vestibulum</i>
(subsequently published); the <i>Janua</i> furnishes the
materials for the building; and the <i>Atrium</i> provides
the decorations. With the completion of these, pupils
may confer with the wisest authors through their
books, and through this reading they may become
learned, wise, and eloquent.</p>

<p>The second part treats of substantives, as the classification
of things; the third part of adjectives, as the
modification of things; the fourth part explains pronouns;
in the fifth part verbs are introduced; the
sixth part discusses adverbs, the seventh part prepositions,
the eighth part conjunctions, and the ninth part
interjections. The tenth part contains examples of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
the derivation of words. The <i>Atrium</i> was intended as
a simplified Latin grammar to be used with the graded
system of language teaching outlined by Comenius.</p>

<p>The <i>Vestibulum</i>, although written and published
after the <i>Janua</i> and <i>Atrium</i>, was intended as a first
book or Latin primer. The <i>Janua</i> was found to be
too difficult for the younger learners, and so this simple
book was composed during his sojourn at Saros-Patak.
The sentences were abbreviated, and they deal
with simple things. The following are the chapter
headings: (1) Concerning the accidents or qualities of
things; (2) Concerning the actions and passions of
things; (3) The circumstances of things; (4) Things
in the school; (5) Things at home; (6) Things in the
city; (7) Concerning the virtues. He expresses regret
that he is unable to illustrate the text of the <i>Vestibulum</i>
with cuts to amuse the pupils and enable them the
better to remember, but says that he could find no
artists competent to do the required illustrative work.
He urges the teachers to supply the want of such cuts
by explanations of the things, or by showing the things
themselves. Without some such devices, the instruction
must necessarily be lifeless. “The parallelism
of the knowledge of words and things is the deepest
secret of the method.”</p>


<h3><i>Orbis Pictus</i></h3>

<p>The idea of the use of pictures in elementary school
work was suggested to Comenius by Professor Lubinus,
of Rostock, who edited in 1614 a Greek testament in
three languages. He suggested reforms in the simplification
of language instruction, and advised the con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>struction
of a book containing pictures of things, with
a certain number of brief sentences attached to each,
until all the words and phrases of Latin were exhausted.</p>

<p>While at Saros-Patak, he carried into effect the desires
set forth in the <i>Vestibulum</i> with reference to an illustrated
child’s first Latin reader, although the book was
not printed until some years later, because of unexpected
difficulty in finding a skilful engraver in copper.
In a letter to Michel Endter, of Nuremberg, who subsequently
published the <i>Orbis pictus</i>, Comenius wrote
in 1655: “It may be observed that many of our children
grow weary of their books, because they are overfilled
with things which have to be explained by the
help of words. The pupils, and often the teachers
themselves, know next to nothing about the things.”</p>

<p>The <i>Orbis pictus</i> was first published at Nuremberg
in 1657; and, although the <i>Janua</i> had been received
with well-nigh universal favor, its popularity was surpassed
by the illustrated book. I have no means of
knowing how many editions of the <i>Orbis pictus</i> have
appeared during the last two hundred and fifty years.
I have myself seen twelve different editions in the
British Museum, Comenius-Stiftung, library of Harvard
University, and elsewhere. These are: Nuremberg,
1657, Latin-German; London, 1658, Latin-English;
Amsterdam, 1673, Latin-Dutch-German; Nuremberg,
1679, Latin-German-Italian-French; London, 1727,
Latin-English; Nuremberg, 1746, Latin-German; London,
1777, Latin-German; St. Petersburg, 1808, Latin-Russian-German;
New York, 1810, Latin-English;
Wroctawin, 1818, Latin-Polish-French-German; Königsgratz,
1883, Latin-Bohemian-German-French; Syracuse,
1887, Latin-English.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span></p>

<p>The purpose of the <i>Orbis pictus</i>, as indicated by
Comenius in the preface, was:</p>

<p>1. To entice witty children to learn; for it is apparent
that children, even from their infancy, are delighted
with pictures and willingly please their eyes
with them. And it will be very well worth the pains
to have once brought it to pass that scarecrows may
be taken away out of wisdom’s gardens.</p>

<p>2. This same little book will serve to stir up the
attention, which is to be fastened upon things, and
even to be sharpened more and more, which is also an
important matter. For the senses being the main
guides of childhood (because therein the mind does not
as yet rise to an abstract contemplation of things), they
must evermore seek their own objects; if the objects
are not present, the senses grow dull and flit hither
and thither out of weariness. But when the objects
are present, they grow merry, wax lively, and willingly
suffer themselves to be fastened upon them till the
things be sufficiently discerned. This book, then, will
do a good piece of service in taking flickering wits and
preparing them for deeper studies.</p>

<p>3. Children being thus interested and the attention
attracted, they may be furnished with the knowledge
of the most important things by sport and merry pastime.
In a word, this book will add pleasure to the use
of the <i>Vestibulum</i> and <i>Janua</i>, for which end it was at
the first chiefly intended. The accounts of the things
being given in the mother-tongue, the book promises
three good things: (1) It will afford a device for learning
to read more easily than hitherto, especially having
a symbolical alphabet set before it, with pictures of
the voices [creatures] to be imitated. The young ABC<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
pupils will easily remember the force of every character
by looking at the creatures, and the imagination
will be strengthened. Having looked over a table of
the chief syllables, the children may proceed to view
the pictures and the inscriptions set under them.
Simply looking upon the object pictured will suggest
the name of the object and tell how the picture is to
be read. Thus the whole book being gone over by the
bare use of the pictures, reading cannot but be learned.
(2) The book being used in the vernacular will serve
for the perfect learning of the mother-tongue. (3) The
learning of the vernacular words will serve as a pleasant
introduction to the Latin tongue.</p>

<p>The <i>Orbis pictus</i> was translated for use in English
schools in 1658 by Charles Hoole, a London schoolmaster.
He observes in his introduction: “There are
few of you (I think) but have seen, and with great
willingness have made use of (or at least pursued),
many of the books of this well-deserving author, Mr.
John Comenius, which, for their profitableness to the
speedy attainment of a language, have been translated
into several countries, out of Latin into their native
tongue. Now the general verdict (after trial made)
that hath passed, touching those formerly extant, is
this, that they are indeed of singular use, and very
advantageous to those of more discretion (especially of
such as already have a smattering of Latin) to help
their memories to retain what they have scatteringly
gotten here and there, to furnish them with many
words, which (perhaps) they have not formerly read,
or so well observed; but to young children (whom we
have chiefly to instruct), as to those that are ignorant
altogether of things and words, and prove rather a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
mere toil and burden, than a delight and furtherance.
For to pack up many words in memory of things not
conceived in the mind, is to fill the head with empty
imaginations, and to make the learner more to admire
the multitude and variety (and thereby to become discouraged)
than to care to treasure them up in hopes to
gain more knowledge of what they mean.”</p>

<p>The first lesson in the <i>Orbis pictus</i> is a dialogue
between a teacher and a pupil. The former says,
“Come, boy, learn to be wise.” Whereupon the latter
asks, “What doth this mean?” The master makes
reply, “To understand rightly, to do rightly, and to
speak rightly all that are necessary.” The boy asks
who will teach him these things, to which the master
makes reply, “I, by God’s help, will guide thee
through all. I will show thee all; I will name thee
all.” To all this the boy makes eager response: “See,
here I am. Lead me in the name of God.” The master
concludes the dialogue with this injunction:
“Before all things thou oughtest to learn the plain
sounds of which man’s speech consisteth, which living
creatures know how to make, and thy tongue knoweth
how to imitate, and thy hand can picture out. Afterward
we will go into the world, and we will view all
things.” Mr. Maxwell<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> thus characterizes this introduction
and the picture that illustrates it: “The boy,
a plump but not a pleasing person, and the master, a
man ‘severe’ and ‘stern to view,’ who has evidently
all the frowns and none of the jokes of Goldsmith’s
schoolmaster. They are conversing on a barren plain,
the only other living thing in sight being a wild ani<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>mal
apparently of some extinct species. In the background
are a village church, of the regulation pattern,
the roofs of houses, and a couple of pyramids which
are intended for mountains.”</p>

<p>The introduction is followed by an illustrated lesson
on the sounds of the letters of the alphabet, with a
picture and statement (in the vernacular and Latin)
of the sounds made by animals. The crow illustrates
the sound of <i>a</i>, the statement in the English being, “The
crow crieth”; in the Latin, <i>Cornix cornicatur</i>. A
lamb illustrates the sound of <i>b</i>, the statement being,
“The lamb bleateth” (Latin, <i>Agnus balat</i>). And so on
through the alphabet. This is what Comenius calls
“a lively and vocal alphabet.”</p>

<p>Like the <i>Janua</i>, the subjects treated in the <i>Orbis
pictus</i> cover a wide range of topics. Their character
may be indicated by the following citations of chapter
headings: God, the world, the heavens, fire, the air,
the water, the clouds, the earth, the fruits of the earth,
metals, stones, trees, fruits of trees, flowers, potherbs,
corn, shrubs, birds, tame fowls, singing birds, birds
that haunt the fields and woods, ravenous birds, waterfowls,
ravenous vermin, animals about the house, herd-cattle,
laboring beasts, wild cattle, wild beasts, serpents
and creeping things, crawling vermin, creatures
that live as well by water as by land, river-fish and
pond-fish, sea-fish and shell-fish, man, the seven ages
of man, the outward parts of man, the head and the
hand, the flesh and bowels, the charnels and bones, the
outward and inward senses, the soul of man, deformed
and monstrous people, dressing of gardens, husbandry,
grazing, grinding, bread-making, fishing, fowling,
hunting, butchery, cookery, the vintage, brewing, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
feast, and so on to the one hundred and fifty-first
chapter, in which the first illustration is reproduced
with this benediction by the master: “Thus thou
hast seen in short all things that can be shewed, and
hast learned the chief words of the Latin and mother-tongue.
Go on now and read other good books diligently,
and thou shalt become learned, wise and
godly. Remember these things: Fear God and call
upon him that he may bestow upon thee the spirit of
wisdom. Farewell.”</p>

<p>Under the pictures illustrating each chapter follows
the descriptions in the vernacular and the Latin. The
following on the school may be taken as characteristic
of the book:—</p>

<p>The braced figures refer to the objects numbered
in the cut; for example, a group of students conversing
together in the illustration is marked 10 in the
cut and in the text. The purpose of Comenius, it
should be noted in passing, was primarily to teach the
vernacular through things and the representation of
things; although he had no objection to the learning
of the Latin with the vernacular. His aim, as stated
by himself, “That instruction may progress without
hindrance, and neither learning nor teaching delay,
since what is printed in words may be brought before
the eyes by sight, and thus the mind may be instructed
without error.”</p>

<p>“Primer though it be,” says G. Stanley Hall, “the
<i>Orbis pictus</i> sheds a broad light over the whole field
of education.” Compayré remarks, “It was the first
practical application of the intuitive method, and has
served as a model for the innumerable illustrated
books which for three centuries have invaded the
schools.” And Raumer, who is little given to praise
of Comenius and his schemes, adds, “The <i>Orbis pictus</i>
was the forerunner of future development, and had for
its object, not merely the introduction of an indistinct
painted world into the school, but, as much as possible,
a knowledge of the original world itself, by actual
intercourse with it.”</p>

<p>Professor Laurie is doubtless right when he says
that Comenius knew little psychology—scarcely more
than the generalizations of Plato and Aristotle, and
these not strictly investigated by himself. Yet who
can read these lines in the preface of the <i>Orbis pictus</i>,
“This little book will serve to stir up the attention,
which is to be fastened upon things, and ever to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
sharpened more and more; for the senses ever more
seek their own objects, and when the objects are
present, they grow merry, wax lively, and willingly
suffer themselves to be fastened upon them, until the
things are sufficiently discerned”—who can read these
lines, and reflect upon the manner in which volitional
attention operates in the higher spheres of thought and
emotion, and say that Comenius was altogether ignorant
of the psychological law that the power of the will
over the attention of little children is largely a matter
of automatic fixation, depending upon the attractiveness
of the objects that affect the senses.</p>


<h3><i>Methodus Novissima</i></h3>

<p>While residing at Elbing, Comenius wrote the
<i>Methodus novissima</i> for the use of the teachers of
Sweden. This he intended as a plan of studies, and it
contains the principles which must lie at the basis of
every rational course of study. The three principles
of his method are the parallelism of things and words,
proper stages of succession, and easy natural progress.
In God are the ideas, the original types which he
impresses upon things; things, again, impress their
representation upon the senses, the senses impart
them to the mind, the mind to the tongue, and the
tongue to the ears of others; for souls shut up in
bodies cannot understand each other in a purely
intellectual way.</p>

<p>Any language is complete in so far as it possesses a
full nomenclature, has words for everything,—and
these significant and consistent,—and is constructed
in accordance with fixed grammatical laws. It is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
source of error when things accommodate themselves
to words, instead of words to things. The same
classification prevails for words as for things; and
whoever understands the relation of words among
themselves will, the more easily, study the analogous
relations among things.</p>

<p>Vives thought that the most complete language
would be that in which the words express the nature
of things, and Comenius believed that there could be
composed a real language in which each word should
be a definition.</p>

<p>To be able to represent a thing by the mind, hand,
or tongue is to understand it. The mental process
involved consists of representations and images of the
pictures of things. If, says Comenius, I perceive a
thing by the senses, its image is impressed upon my
brain; if I represent a thing, I impress its image upon
the material; but if I express in words the thing
which I have thought of or represented, I impress it
upon the atmosphere, and through it upon the ear,
brain, and mind of another.</p>

<p>Things are learned by examples, rules, and practice.
Before the understanding, truth must be held up as
an example; before the will, the good; before the
forming powers, the ideal; and to these must be
added practice regulated by suitable rules. But rules
should not be given before the examples. This
is well understood by artisans; they do not begin
by lecturing to their apprentices upon trades, but by
showing them how masters work and then by putting
tools in their hands and training them to imitate
their masters. We learn to do by doing, to write
by writing, and to paint by painting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span></p>

<p>The second step must never be taken until the first
is learned; and the first step should be repeated and
assimilated with the second step. We should advance
from the easy to the more difficult, from the near to
the more distant, and from the simple to the complex.
Proceed toward knowledge by the perception and
understanding of objects present to the senses, and
later to the information of others about the objects.</p>

<p>The attention should be fixed upon one object at a
time; first upon the whole, then upon the parts. The
understanding should compare the objects being perceived
with similar objects previously observed. The
memory has three offices: to receive impressions, to
retain impressions, and to recall impressions. Retention
will be made easier by repetition, and recollection
by the association of perceived relations. The youngest
children should be instructed by means of visible
objects, and pictures impress themselves most firmly
upon the memory.</p>

<p>Teachers who are themselves intellectually quick
must avoid impatience. The pupils who learn the
quickest are not always the best; and the dulness of
the pupils must be supplemented by the teacher’s
industry. Learning will be easy to pupils if teachers
manage them in a friendly way and study the disposition
of each child. Children must not only be made
to look at their lessons, but to enter into the spirit of
the subject under consideration.</p>

<p>We should remember that schools are the workshops
of humanity; and that they should work their pupils
into the right and skilful use of their reason, speech,
and talents—into wisdom, eloquence, readiness, and
shrewdness. Thus will the teachers shape these little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
images of God, or, rather, fill up the outlines of goodness,
power, and wisdom impressed upon them by
divine power. The art of teaching is no shallow
affair, but one of the deepest mysteries of nature and
salvation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is less easy to trace the influence of Comenius on
modern educational reformers than to indicate the
traces of his pedagogic development, since he read
widely and credited cheerfully the paternity of his
educational ideals. He says in this connection: “I
gave my mind to the perusal of divers authors, and
lighted upon many which at this age have made a
beginning in reforming the method of studies, as
Ratke, Helwig, Rheinus, Ritter, Glaum, Cæcil, and,
who indeed should have the first place, John Valentine
Andreæ, a man of noble and clear brain; as also Campanella
and the Lord Verulam, those famous restorers
of philosophy; by reading of whom I was raised in
good hope, that at last those so many various sparks
would conspire into a flame; yet observing here and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
there some defects and gaps, I could not contain
myself from attempting something that might rest
upon an immovable foundation, and which, if it could
be once found out, should not be subject to any ruin.
Therefore, after many workings and tossings of my
thoughts, by reducing everything to the immovable
laws of nature, I lighted upon my <i>Great didactic</i>,
which shows the art of teaching all things to all men.”</p>

<p>Such commendable frankness is not always found in
the reformers that follow Comenius; but in their writings
it is not difficult to discern community of ideas
first definitely formulated by Comenius. This holds
true in a degree of all reformers since Comenius’ day,
but in a measure sufficiently large to require passing
note in Francke, Rousseau, Basedow Pestalozzi, Fröbel,
and Herbart.</p>


<h3><i>Francke</i><a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></h3>

<p>Of a profoundly religious nature like Comenius,
Francke applied himself to the study of theology at the
Universities of Kiel and Leipzig, after having studied
at Erfurt. The listless and heartless character of the
teaching and study at these institutions impressed him
profoundly, and directed his attention to the need of
educational reform. Four years after taking his degree
at Leipzig (1688), he established an infant school at
Hamburg, which, though brief, was, as he tells us, the
richest and happiest experience of his long and varied
career. It taught him the lesson which he thought
was needed alike by himself and his contemporaries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>—
that teachers of little children entered upon their work
with altogether too little preparation. He says, “Upon
the establishment of this school, I learned how destructive
is the usual school management, and how exceedingly
difficult is the discipline of children; and this
reflection made me desire that God would make me
worthy to do something for the improvement of schools
and instruction.”</p>

<p>He received an ecclesiastical call to Erfurt, which he
accepted, but his orthodoxy was questioned and he was
not permitted to fill the office to which he had been
appointed. The foundation of the University of Halle,
in 1691, made an opening for him in the chair of
Greek and Oriental languages. While serving in this
capacity, he organized the philanthropic institution
which has made Halle famous. It began as a charity
work among the poor, and grew to such proportions
that at his death, in 1727,—thirty-three years after
its inception,—it included (1) the pædagogium with
eighty-two students and seventy teachers and pupil-teachers;
(2) the Latin school of the orphanage with
three inspectors, thirty-two teachers, four hundred
pupils, and ten servants; (3) elementary schools in
Halle for the children of citizens, employing four
inspectors, ninety-eight male and eight female teachers,
and having an enrollment of one thousand and
twenty-five children; (4) apothecary shops and bookstores.
As a charity school, Francke’s institution
became the model of hundreds organized in Europe
during the next century.</p>

<p>The pædagogium, which was a part of the great
philanthropic institution, was opened in 1696, as a
select school for the sons of noblemen. It was one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
of the earliest training schools for teachers, and the
forerunner of university pedagogical seminaries,
which, in Germany at least, serve as training schools
for teachers in secondary schools. Francke aimed to
fit young men, and particularly university students,
in the faculties of philosophy and theology, for greater
usefulness as teachers. Indeed, much of the teaching
in the pædagogium was done by the university students
who contemplated teaching careers. Besides the
practice work, instruction was given in the history
and theory of education, methods of teaching, and
school organization and government. Francke’s pædagogium
was a worthy progenitor of the long line of
renowned university seminaries which are now integral
factors of the German universities, such, for
example, as the deservedly noted pedagogical seminary
at Jena under the direction of Professor Wilhelm
Rein, and the not less noted pedagogical seminaries at
Leipzig under Professors Volkelt, Schiller, and Richter.</p>

<p>Like Comenius, Francke valued less the classical
culture, but more the modern learning which fitted for
the duties of life. “It is a common evil,” he says,
“that we do not teach what we use in our occupations
every day.” This led him to give large consideration
to the study of the mother-tongue. “I find few university
students,” he says, “who can write a German
letter correctly spelled. They violate orthography in
almost every line. I know of many examples where,
after they have entered upon the ministry and have
had occasion to have something printed, it has been
necessary to have their manuscripts first corrected in
almost every line. The reason for this defect is usually
in the schools, where only the Latin translation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
of their exercises is corrected, but not the German.”
In many ways he labored to actualize the larger idea
of education which Comenius had outlined in the
<i>Great didactic</i>.</p>


<h3><i>Rousseau</i></h3>

<p>While he does not mention Comenius by name, even
a cursory reading of the <i>Émile</i><a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> furnishes abundant
evidence of Rousseau’s familiarity with the writings
of the Moravian reformer, if not at first hand, then
through the writings of others. At any rate, some
striking parallels are suggested in a comparative study
of the writings of the two reformers. As summarized
by Mr. Davidson,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> Rousseau’s educational demands
are threefold: (1) the demand that children should,
from the moment of their birth, be allowed complete
freedom of movement; (2) that they should be educated
through direct experience, and not through mere
information derived from books; (3) that they should
be taught to use their hands in the production of useful
articles. These demands, it will be recalled, were
also made by Comenius in one form or another.</p>

<p>Comenius and Rousseau both emphasized the fact
that school systems must be made for children, and
not children for school systems. Neither reformer
shared the schoolmaster’s customary contempt for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
childhood, but both urged that childhood must be
studied and loved to be understood and trained, and
both, if they had lived in the nineteenth and twentieth
centuries, would have been enthusiastic advocates of
child study. Says Rousseau: “We do not understand
childhood, and pursuing false ideas of it, our every
step takes us farther astray. The wisest among us
fix upon what it concerns men to know, without ever
considering what children are capable of learning.
They always expect to find the man in the child, without
thinking of what the child is before it is a man....
We never know how to put ourselves in the
place of children; we do not enter into their ideas;
we attribute to them our own; and following always
our own train of thought, even with syllogisms, we
manage to fill their heads with nothing but extravagance
and error.... I wish some discreet person
would give us a treatise on the art of observing children—an
art which would be of immense value to us,
but of which parents and teachers have not as yet
learnt the very rudiments.”</p>

<p>Sense training was fundamental in Comenius’
scheme of primary education. Nature studies—plants,
animals, and minerals—were introduced from
the first, that the child might early cultivate his
powers of observation, and form the habit of acquiring
knowledge at first hand. Rousseau likewise lays
great stress on sense training. “The faculties which
become strong in us,” he says, “are our senses. These,
then, are the first that should be cultivated; they are,
in fact, the only faculties we forget, or at least those
which we neglect most completely. The child wants
to touch and handle everything. By no means check<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
this restlessness; it points to a very necessary apprenticeship.
Thus it is that the child gets to be conscious
of the hotness or coldness, the hardness or softness,
the heaviness or lightness of bodies, to judge of their
size and shape and all their sensible properties by
looking, feeling, listening, especially by comparing
sight and touch, and combining the sensations of the
eye with those of the fingers.”</p>

<p>Comenius, Rousseau, and, in fact, all the realists
from Bacon to Herbert Spencer, have emphasized the
thought that education should follow the order and
method of nature; though, as Professor Payne suggests,
it is not always easy to form a clear notion of
what they mean by nature, when they say that education
should be natural, and that teachers should follow
the method of nature. The key-note of Rousseau’s
theory, as expressed in the opening paragraph of the
<i>Émile</i>, is that “everything is good as it comes from
the hands of the author of nature, but everything
degenerates in the hands of man.” Mr. Davidson
points out in his study of Rousseau that the air was
full of nature panaceas during the middle years of the
eighteenth century, and that these were applied alike
to social, political, and educational institutions. He
says: “The chief of these notions were (1) a state of
nature as man’s original condition—a state conceived
sometimes as one of goodness, peace, freedom, equality,
and happiness, sometimes as one of badness, war,
slavery, inequality, and misery; (2) a law of nature
independent of all human enactment, and yet binding
upon all men; (3) a social contract, voluntarily and
consciously made, as the basis of justification for civil
society and authority—a contract by which men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
united for the protection of rights and the enforcement
of laws which had existed already in the state
of nature; (4) false inequality among men, as due to
private property, or the usurpation by some of what,
by natural right, belonged to all; (5) a peaceful,
untroubled, unenterprising, unstruggling existence as
the normal form of human life.”</p>

<p>While less sane, less practical, less comprehensive
in his educational views than Comenius, it can scarcely
be said that he was less influential. Differing in many
important particulars, a common ideal permeates the
writings of the two reformers—an unbounded faith
in the possibilities of youth, and a deep conviction that
it is the business of teachers to view the world and
nature from the standpoint of young and growing
children, and to cling with less tenacity to points of
view established by antiquity and convention.</p>


<h3><i>Basedow</i><a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></h3>

<p>While resembling Rousseau more than Comenius in
temperament and character, as well as in educational
ideals, there is yet much in Basedow’s educational
scheme that recalls the Moravian reformer. Born at
Hamburg, in 1727, he experienced, like Rousseau, an
unhappy childhood, and, like Comenius, received a
belated education. He prepared for the University of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
Leipzig at the Hamburg gymnasium; but at both
institutions he rebelled against the traditional methods
of instruction. After completing the course in
theology at Leipzig, it was found that he had grown
too heterodox for ordination, and he engaged himself
as a private tutor to a gentleman in Holstein.
Remarkable success attended his labors as a teacher.
He studied his children, adapted subject-matter to
their capacities, and made extensive use of conversational
methods. This experience secured him an
appointment in Denmark, where he taught for eight
years. But his essays on <i>Methodical instruction in
natural and Biblical religion</i> disturbed alike the serenity
of the Danish clergy and schoolmasters, and
he was released and called to the gymnasium at
Altoona, where he encountered opposition no less
pronounced.</p>

<p>Rousseau’s <i>Émile</i> appeared at this time, and it
influenced him powerfully. He renewed his attacks on
contemporary educational practices; charged universal
neglect of physical education and the mother-tongue;
criticised the schools for devoting so much time to the
study of Latin and Greek, and for the mechanical and
uninteresting methods employed in teaching these
languages; and admonished society for neglecting to
instruct the children of the poor and middle classes.
Raumer, who is no admirer of Basedow, admits the
justice of the charges. He says: “Youth was in
those days for most children a sadly harassed period.
Instruction was hard and heartlessly severe. Grammar
was caned into the memory; so were portions of
Scripture and poetry. A common form of school punishment
was to learn by heart the One Hundred and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
Nineteenth Psalm. Schoolrooms were dismally dark.
No one conceived it possible that the young could find
pleasure in any kind of work, or that they had eyes for
aught but reading and writing. The pernicious age
of Louis XIV had inflicted on the children of the
upper class hair curled by the barber and messed with
powder and pomade, braided coats, knee breeches,
silk stockings, and a dagger by the side—for active,
lively children a perfect torture.”</p>

<p>The publication, in 1774, of his <i>Elementary book
with plates</i> and his <i>Book of methods</i> for parents and
teachers, formulated and brought to public notice his
views on education. The <i>Elementary book with plates</i>
followed closely the lines of Comenius, and it has
often been called the <i>Orbis pictus</i> of the eighteenth
century. The purpose of the book was clearly encyclopædic.
As stated by himself, his aims were:
(1) elementary instruction in the knowledge of words
and things; (2) an incomparable method, founded
upon experience, of teaching children to read without
weariness or loss of time; (3) natural knowledge;
(4) knowledge of morals, the mind, and reasoning;
(5) a thorough and impressive method of instructing
in natural religion, and for a description of beliefs so
impartial that it shall not appear of what belief is the
writer himself; (6) knowledge of social duties and
commerce. The work was published in four volumes
and illustrated by one hundred plates.</p>

<p>The <i>Book of methods</i> presents the root-ideas of
Comenius and Rousseau. In it he says: “You should
attend to nature in your children far more than to art.
The elegant manners and usages of the world are, for
the most part, unnatural. These come of themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
in later years. Treat children like children, that they
may remain the longer uncorrupted. A boy whose
acutest faculties are his senses, and who has no perception
of anything abstract, must first of all be made
acquainted with the world as it presents itself to the
senses. Let this be shown him in nature herself, or,
where this is impossible, in faithful drawings or
models. Thereby can he, even in play, learn how the
various objects are to be named. Comenius alone has
pointed out the right road in this matter. By all
means reduce the wretched exercises of the memory.”</p>

<p>The institution which carried Basedow’s educational
theories into practice was the Philanthropinum at
Dessau, which became both famous and notorious in
the days of the founder, and exercised, withal, a
powerful influence on the pedagogy of Germany and
Switzerland during the last quarter of the eighteenth
and the first half of the nineteenth century. Whatever
may have been its faults, it had the merit of
looking at education from a more modern standpoint.
With the conviction that the final word had not been
spoken on pedagogy, Basedow boldly determined to
find new methods of approach to the child’s mind.
As an experiment the Philanthropinum was both interesting
and suggestive. Kant, who recognizes this
aspect of its utility, says: “It was imagined that
experiments in education were not necessary; but this
was a great mistake. Experience shows very often
that results are produced precisely the opposite to
those which had been expected. We also see from
experiments that one generation cannot work out a
complete plan of education. The only experimental
school which has made a beginning toward breaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
the path is the institution at Dessau. Whatever its
faults, this praise must be given it: It is the only
school in which teachers have had the liberty to work
out their own methods and plans, and where they
stood in connection, not only with each other, but with
men of learning throughout all Germany.”</p>

<p>In subjects taught, as well as in methods of teaching,
Basedow followed Comenius in the main. Words
were taught in connection with things; object teaching
occupied an important place; pictures were extensively
used; children were first taught to speak and
later to write in foreign languages; German and
French held positions of honor; arithmetic, geometry,
geography, and natural history were all taught; great
attention was given to the physical development of
the children, and play was considered as important as
Latin; school hours were shortened; the discipline
was much less severe; and the children were allowed
and permitted to take degrees of freedom altogether
unheard of before Basedow’s day.</p>


<h3><i>Pestalozzi</i><a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></h3>

<p>Pestalozzi was not widely read in the literature of
education; in fact, the <i>Émile</i> was about the only such
book he ever read, as he himself tells us. It is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
nevertheless, apparent that he was quite as much
influenced by Comenius as by Rousseau. The vital
principle of his reforms—love of and sympathy for
the child—had been as forcefully enunciated by
Comenius as by Rousseau; and the saner and more
practical character of Pestalozzi’s enthusiasm would
lead one to suppose that he was less influenced by the
author of the <i>Émile</i> than by the Moravian reformer.
“The first qualification for the task [of teaching],”
says Pestalozzi, in a letter to Greaves,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> “is <i>thinking
love</i>.” And this spirit dominated all his efforts in
behalf of educational reform. He says: “It is recorded
that God opened the heavens to the patriarch of old,
and showed him a ladder leading thither. This ladder
is let down to every descendant of Adam; it is offered
to your child. But he must be taught to climb it—not
by the cold calculations of the head, or by the
mere impulses of the heart, but by a combination of
both.”</p>

<p>Both reformers started with the child at birth,
and made domestic education fundamental to their
schemes. “Maternal love,” says Pestalozzi, “is the
first agent in education. Nature has qualified the
mother to be the chief factor in the education of
the child.” In <i>How Gertrude teaches her children</i><a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a>
he tells us, “It is the main design of my method to
make home instruction again possible to our neglected
people, and to induce every mother whose heart beats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
for her child to make use of my elementary exercises.”
Again, in the account of his school at Stanz, he says:
“My aim was to simplify teaching so that the common
people might be induced to begin the instruction of
their children, and thus render superfluous the teaching
of the elements in the schools. As the mother is
the first to nourish her child physically, so also, by
the appointment of God, she must be the first to give
it spiritual and mental nourishment. I consider that
very great evils have been occasioned by sending children
too early to school; and by adopting so many
artificial means of educating them away from home.
The time will come, so soon as we shall have simplified
instruction, when every mother will be able to
teach, without the help of others, and thereby, at the
same time, go on herself always learning.” This, it
will be recalled, was also Comenius’ cherished desire
in the <i>School of infancy</i>.</p>

<p>Comenius and Pestalozzi stand almost alone among
the great educational reformers in proclaiming the
doctrine of universal education—training for the poor
as well as the rich, for the lowly born as well as for
the privileged classes, for girls as well as boys.
“Popular education,” says Pestalozzi, “once lay before
me like an immense marsh, in the mire of which I
waded about, until I had discovered the source from
which its waters sprang, as well as the causes by
which their free course is obstructed, and made myself
acquainted with those points from which a hope of
draining its pools might be conceived. Ever since my
youthful days, the course of my feelings, which rolled
on like a mighty stream, was directed to this one point,—to
stop the sources of that misery in which I saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
the people around me immersed.” Such regeneration
he thought could be brought about by consecrated and
intelligent schoolmasters, and particularly, as G. Stanley
Hall notes in his admirable introduction to the
American translation of <i>Leonard and Gertrude</i>,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> “by
the love and devotion of noble women overflowing
from the domestic circle into the community, by the
good Gertrudes of all stations in life, the born educators
of the race, whose work and whose ‘key-words’
we men pedagogues must ponder well if our teaching
is to be ethically inspired.”</p>

<p>The study of nature, and this at first hand, was likewise
an inheritance from Comenius. Pestalozzi makes
observation the basis of all knowledge. “If I look
back and ask myself what I have really done toward
the improvement of methods of elementary instruction,
I find that in recognizing observation as the absolute
basis of all knowledge, I have established the first and
most important principle of instruction. I have endeavored
to discover what ought to be the character
of the instruction itself, and what are the fundamental
laws according to which the education of the human
race must be determined by nature.”</p>

<p>Comenius was the first of the educational reformers
to recognize the importance of geography as a subject
of school study; and although he had it taught in the
schools he conducted, and gave it important consideration
in his educational schemes, the study received
no fresh recognition until the time of Pestalozzi.
At Stanz, at Burgdorf, and at Yverdon, geography
ranked as one of the foremost elementary school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
studies. And not only was geography taught in the
schoolrooms, but better than that, it was taught in the
open air. Vulliemin, who was two years a student
under Pestalozzi at Yverdon, writes: “The first elements
of geography were taught us on the ground.
We began the study by taking a walk along a narrow
valley on the outskirts of Yverdon. We were led to
observe all its details, and then to help ourselves to
some clay we found there. This we carried back in
our baskets, and, on our return home, we had to make
a model of the ground walked over, and of the surrounding
country; this we did on long tables. Our
walks were extended, from time to time, and, on our
return, we added new features as we learned them.”</p>

<p>Pestalozzi was fortunate in having with him at
Yverdon two eminently successful German teachers,
who comprehended his aims, and who subsequently
applied his methods in the fatherland. One was Hennig,
the author of a popular pedagogic work on home
geography, and the other was Karl Ritter, the deservedly
renowned German geographer. Ritter brought
with him to Yverdon two young men from Frankfort
whom he was tutoring, and he served Pestalozzi in the
capacity of a pupil-teacher; and, while a developed man
when he entered the institution, in 1807, he came to
Yverdon, as so many other enthusiastic Germans had
done, to study pedagogy with the most distinguished
master of the century. Years later, when Ritter had
become the best-known geographer of his age, he
wrote: “Pestalozzi knew less geography than a child
in one of our primary schools, yet it was from him
that I gained my chief knowledge of this science; for
it was in listening to him that I first conceived the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
idea of the natural method. It was he who opened the
way to me, and I take pleasure in attributing whatever
value my work may have entirely to him.”</p>

<p>Comenius and Pestalozzi had much in common in
their aims as educational reformers; and they together
share, as Dr. Hoffmeister<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> points out, the honor of
having originated and carefully elaborated one of the
most efficient elementary school systems in Europe—the
Volksschule in Germany. Pestalozzi gave himself
to education, or, to use his own significant characterization,
“I have lived all my days like a beggar, that I
might teach beggars how to live like men.” Comenius
gave himself, also, and he gave besides a half-dozen
books, which take classic rank in the permanent literature
of education.</p>


<h3><i>Fröbel</i></h3>

<p>The large obligations of the founder of the kindergarten
to both Comenius and Pestalozzi cannot be
gainsaid. Fröbel’s attention was called to the writings
of the Moravian reformer early in his educational
career by Professor Krause, Herder, and others interested
in his schemes. “Comenius proposes an entirely
new basis of education,” Professor Krause wrote to
Fröbel. “He attempts to find a method of education,
consciously based upon science, whereby teachers will
teach less, and learners will learn more; whereby there
will be less noise in the schools, less distaste, fewer
idle pupils, more happiness and progress; whereby
confusion, division, and darkness will give place to
order, intelligence, and peace.” He adds, “Comenius<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
was the first to advocate Pestalozzi’s doctrine of
observation (Anschauung).” Mr. Hauschmann,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> one
of Fröbel’s biographers, remarks: “Krause looked
upon Fröbel as the educational successor of Comenius
and Pestalozzi. Fröbel, he thought, might show, as
it had never been shown before, how the Pestalozzian
doctrine of Anschauung was to be applied to the
education of every child.”</p>

<p>The weeks spent with Pestalozzi in the autumn of
1805 and the two subsequent years (1808–1810) passed
with him at Yverdon, gave Fröbel ample opportunity
to study thoroughly the Swiss reformer’s theories and
practices; and these he subsequently applied with
even greater skill than his master had done. Schmid,
the German historian of education, says, “Fröbel, the
pupil of Pestalozzi, and a genius like his master, completed
the reformer’s system; taking the results at
which Pestalozzi had arrived through the necessities
of his position, Fröbel developed the ideas involved
in them, not by further experience, but by deduction
from the nature of man, and thus he attained to the
conception of true human development and to the
requirements of true education.”</p>

<p>He was thus, in a sense, the combined product of
the philosophy of Comenius and the zeal of Pestalozzi,
although working along lines carefully marked out by
himself. It does not detract from the fame of Fröbel
to say that most of the root-ideas of his kindergarten
are to be found in the <i>School of infancy</i>. Mr. Bowen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
who has given us one of the best expositions<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> of
Fröbel’s ideas, pays a just tribute of the obligation of
his master to the writings of Pestalozzi and Comenius.
He says: “With all his enthusiasm for education and
his desire to found it on a scientific basis, Comenius
had but little scientific knowledge of child-nature, and
troubled himself not at all to acquire it. He constantly
insisted, it is true, upon the exercise of the
senses, and an education in accordance with nature;
but his exercise of the senses soon reduced itself, in the
main, to the use of pictures, with a view to a readier
and more intelligent acquirement of language; and,
even in his <i>ergastula literaria</i>, or literary workshop,
the manual and other work introduced was intended
to aid poor children in partly getting their own living
while at school, rather than to exercise faculty; while
his ‘nature’ was as quaint and conventional as that
in a pre-Raphaelite picture. <i>None the less, however,
Comenius was the true founder of educational method.</i>”</p>

<p>There is entire agreement in a few of the most fundamental
aims of the two reformers. Comenius, no
less than Fröbel, preached the gospel of self-activity,
and demanded that play be given important consideration
in the training of the child. What Comenius
says on these subjects has already been given in the
exposition of the <i>School of infancy</i>. In his <i>Education
of man</i>,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> Fröbel says: “Play is the purest, most spiritual
activity of the child at this period; and, at the
same time, typical of human life as a whole—of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
hidden natural life in man and all things. It gives,
therefore, joy, freedom, contentment, inner and outer
rest, peace with the world. A child that plays
thoroughly, with self-active determination, perseveringly,
until physical fatigue forbids, will surely be a
thorough, determined man, capable of self-sacrifice for
the promotion of the welfare of himself and others.
Is not the most beautiful expression of child-life at
this time a playing child?—a child wholly absorbed
in his play?—a child that has fallen asleep while so
absorbed?... The plays of the child contain the
germ of the whole life that is to follow; for the man
develops and manifests himself in play, and reveals the
noblest aptitudes and the deepest elements of his
being.”</p>

<p>Fröbel joined with Comenius in demanding that
women shall take a responsible part in the education
of the child. Mr. James L. Hughes<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> says in this
connection: “The greatest step made toward the full
recognition of woman’s individuality and responsibility
since the time of Christ was made when Fröbel
founded his kindergartens and made women educators
outside the home—educators by profession. This
momentous reform gave the first great impetus to the
movement in favor of women’s freedom, and provided
for the general advance of humanity to a higher plane
by giving childhood more considerate, more sympathetic,
and more stimulating teachers.” Fröbel was
convinced that women were better adapted than men
for the early stages of instruction. He says: “All
agree that, compared with the true mother, the formal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
educator is but a bungler. But she must become conscious
of her own aim, and must learn intelligently
the means to reach it. She can no longer afford to
squander or neglect the earliest years of her child.
As the world grows older, we become richer in knowledge
and art. But childhood remains short as before.”</p>

<p>In other important particulars Fröbel owed much to
Comenius, as well as to Pestalozzi. Compare, for
example, the <i>School of infancy</i> with the aims of the
kindergarten, and the bequests of the Moravian
reformer will at once be apparent. The exaggerated
and unpedagogic symbolism, however, with which
Fröbel burdened his otherwise excellent kindergarten
system, formed no part of his heritage from Comenius.</p>


<h3><i>Herbart</i></h3>

<p>Professor De Garmo,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> who has given us a most
succinct statement of Herbart’s educational views,
remarks, “that one of the main results of Comenius,
Rousseau, and Pestalozzi is the firmly fixed conviction
that observation, or the use of the senses, and, in
general, the consideration of simple concrete facts in
every field of knowledge, is the sure foundation upon
which all right elementary education rests. This
truth is now the acknowledged starting-point of all
scientific methods of teaching. Yet the fact of importance
of observation in instruction does not carry with
it any information showing how the knowledge so
obtained can be utilized, or what its nature, time,
amount, and order of presentation should be. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
short, it does not show how mental assimilation can
best take place, or how the resulting acquisitions can
be made most efficiently to influence the emotional and
volitional sides of our nature. Perception is, indeed,
the first stage of cognition, but its equally important
correlative is apperception and assimilation. It is
Herbart and his successors who have made us distinctly
conscious of this fact.” There can be no
reasonable doubt but that Herbart did give a powerful
impulse to the judicious assimilation of acquired
sense-experience; and yet even here it is quite possible
to underestimate the character and value of the
nature studies of Comenius and the object lessons of
Pestalozzi.</p>

<p>Herbart, like Comenius, emphasized the necessary
effect of all instruction on character. “The circle of
thought,” says Herbart, “contains the store of that
which by degrees can mount by the steps of interest
to desire, and then, by means of action, to volition.
Further, it contains the store upon which all the
workings of prudence are founded—in it are the
knowledge and care, without which man cannot pursue
his aims through means. The whole inner activity,
indeed, has its abode in the circle of thought. Here
is found the initiative life, the primal energy; here
all must circulate easily and freely, everything must
be in its place, ready to be found and used at any
moment; nothing must lie in the way, and nothing
like a heavy load impede useful activity.” Indeed,
as Kern suggests, in Herbart’s scheme interest is the
moral monitor and protector against the servitude that
springs from passions and desires.</p>

<p>The doctrine of interest, but vaguely suggested by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
Comenius, is perhaps the most noteworthy contribution
of Herbart to modern pedagogy; but to summarize
Herbart’s views on interest would be to summarize
his whole theory of education. He recognizes two
groups of interests—intellectual and social. Two
phases of intellectual interests are distinguished:
(1) empirical interests, or the pleasures occasioned
by disinterested curiosity; (2) speculative interests
occasioned by the impulse to search out causal relations;
and (3) æsthetic interests aroused through
beauties in nature, art, and character. The social
interests are likewise threefold: (1) sympathetic or
altruistic; (2) social and fraternal; and (3) religious.</p>

<p>Herbart’s contribution to empirical psychology,
although important, was second to his application of
direct pedagogic problems to actual school practice—the
working out of his doctrine of many-sided interest,
the selection and adjustment of materials of instruction,
and the reform of school government and
discipline.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a></p>

<small>PERMANENT INFLUENCE OF COMENIUS</small></h2></div>



<p class="indent f08">General neglect of Comenius during the eighteenth century—Causes—Intrenchment
of humanism—Summary of the permanent
reforms of Comenius—Revived interest in his teachings—National
Comenius pedagogical library at Leipzig—The Comenius
Society—Reviews published for the dissemination of the
educational doctrines of Comenius—Conquest of his ideas.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> permanent influence of Comenius remains to
be noted. Famous in his own day; enjoying the
friendship of great scholars and the confidence of royal
personages; the founder of numerous school systems;
the author of more than a hundred books and treatises,
which were translated into most of the languages of
Europe and Asia,—the name of the great Moravian
reformer was quite if not entirely forgotten, and his
writings practically unknown, for more than a century
after his death. Professor Nicholas Murray Butler,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a>
in likening him unto the stream that loses itself in the
arid desert and then reappears with gathered force
and volume to lend its fertilizing power to the surrounding
country, says: “Human history is rich in
analogies to this natural phenomenon; but in Comenius
the history of education furnishes its example. The
great educational revival of our century, and particularly
of our generation, has shed the bright light of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
scholarly investigation into all the dark places, and
to-day, at the three hundredth anniversary of his
birth, the fine old Moravian bishop is being honored
wherever teachers gather together and wherever education
is the theme.”</p>

<p>The world, which usually takes pause for a moment,
when a great man dies, to seriously consider what
there was in the dead that lifted him above the ordinary
level, took no such inventory when the remains
of Comenius were laid at rest in a quiet little town in
Holland. “The man whom we unhesitatingly affirm,”
says Mr. Keatinge, “to be the broadest-minded, the
most far-seeing, the most comprehensive, and withal
the most practical of all writers who have put pen to
paper on the subject of education; the man whose
theories have been put into practice in every school
that is conducted on rational principles; who embodies
the materialistic tendencies of our ‘modern side’
instructors, while avoiding the narrowness of their
reforming zeal; who lays stress on the spiritual aspect
of true education, while he realizes the necessity of
equipping his pupils for the rude struggle with nature
and with fellow-men—Comenius, we say, the prince
of schoolmasters, produced, practically, no effect on
the school organization and educational development
of the following century.”</p>

<p>The causes of this universal neglect are not easily
explained. That he lived most of his days in
exile; that he belonged to a religious community
which was numerically insignificant and which suffered
all those bitter persecutions following in the
train of the Thirty Years’ War; that indiscretion
entangled him in certain alleged prophetic revelations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
which subsequently turned out the baldest impostures;
and, more important than all, as Professor Laurie
points out, that schoolmasters did not wish to be disturbed
by a man with new ideas,—these facts help to
explain the universal neglect into which his name and
writings fell. In a personal letter, Oscar Browning
expresses the belief that if the teachings of Comenius
had been dated a century earlier, that the realistic
type of education might have been generally followed—at
least in the countries that had broken with the
Church of Rome. As it was, however, Melanchthon,
the schoolmaster of the Reformation, adopted, with
slight modifications, the humanistic type of education.
For the time being, at least, the ideas held by
Comenius were pushed into the background, and
humanism, already deeply intrenched, dominated
educational practices. Reformers were not wanting,
however, to champion the reforms of Comenius, men
like Francke, Rousseau, Basedow, Pestalozzi, Fröbel,
and Herbart. But it remained for the nineteenth century
to realize, in considerable measure, the aims and
aspirations of the far-reaching reforms of the Moravian
bishop.</p>

<p>“There is nothing startling about the educational
reforms of Comenius to-day,” says Professor Earl
Barnes. “They are the commonplace talk of all
school conventions. But to see them when no one
else has formulated them, to enunciate them before an
audience often hostile, and to devote a life to teaching
them and working them out—this requires a broad
mind and something of the spirit of the martyr, and
both these elements were strong in Comenius.”</p>

<p>In spite of the neglect into which the reforms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
Comenius fell, his influence has been lasting because
his work was constructive and his reforms were far
reaching. Among the reforms which he advocated (and
since incorporated in the modern educational movement),
the following may be named:—</p>

<p>1. That the purpose of education is to fit for complete
living, in consequence of which its benefits must
be extended to all classes of society.</p>

<p>2. That education should follow the course and
order of nature, and be adapted to the stages of mental
development of the child.</p>

<p>3. That intellectual progress is conditioned at every
step by bodily vigor, and that to attain the best results,
physical exercises must accompany and condition
mental training.</p>

<p>4. That children must first be trained in the
mother-tongue, and that all the elementary knowledge
should be acquired through that medium.</p>

<p>5. That nature study must be made the basis of all
primary instruction, so that the child may exercise his
senses and be trained to acquire knowledge at first
hand.</p>

<p>6. That the child must be wisely trained during its
earliest years, for which purpose mothers must be
trained for the high and holy mission of instructing
little children, and women generally be given more
extended educational opportunities.</p>

<p>7. That the school course must be enriched by the
addition of such useful studies as geography and
history.</p>

<p>8. That the subjects of study must be so correlated
and coördinated that they may form a common unit
of thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span></p>

<p>9. That teachers must be specially trained.</p>

<p>10. That schools must be more rationally graded
and better supervised.</p>

<p>11. That languages must be taught as “living
organic wholes fitted for the purposes of life, and not
as the lifeless tabulations of the grammarians.”</p>

<p>It was the opinion of Mr. Quick that the most
hopeful sign of the improvement of education was the
rapid advance in the last thirty years of the fame of
Comenius, and the growth of a large literature about
the man and his ideas. The revival of Comenian
ideas really dates from the beginning of the present
century, when Germany, crushed and dismembered,
looked to her schools as the surest means of regaining
fallen glory; so that the battle of Jena may be given
as the date of this awakened interest in the reforms of
the Moravian educator. This interest culminated in
the foundation of the great national Comenius pedagogical
library (Comenius-Stiftung) at Leipzig, in
1871. It was founded by a band of enthusiastic disciples
of Comenius, of whom Julius Beeger was the
foremost; and, although it numbered but 2642 volumes
at the end of the first year, the interest in the
movement has been so great that it now numbers
over 70,000 volumes, and constitutes the largest
single collection of pedagogical books in the world.
The books are classified in 56 departments, the most
important of which are: encyclopædias of pedagogy,
complete collections of the writings of standard educational
writers, sources of history of education,
general works on the history of education, histories of
special periods in education, histories of education in
different countries, histories of individual educational<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
institutions, educational biographies, works on systematic
pedagogy, physical education, etc. The library
covers every department of educational thought, and
is especially strong in the literature relating to the
elementary schools of Germany. The privileges of
the library are freely open to all students of education.
The library is under the control of the Leipzig
teachers’ association, and is sustained in part by the
association and in part by appropriations from the
city of Leipzig and the kingdom of Saxony.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> What
more appropriate memorial to the long and devoted
life of Comenius to the cause of education could be
desired, and what stronger evidence of the permanent
influence of his work and worth.</p>

<p>A second recent manifestation of the permanency of
the Moravian educator’s influence is the Comenius
Society (Comenius-Gesellschaft), with headquarters in
Germany, and numbering among its members most of
the leaders in educational thought in the world. It
was organized in 1891. The objects of the society are
(1) to spread the living influence of the spirit of
Comenius and the men who have represented cognate
reforms; (2) to work toward an increased knowledge
of the past and a healthy development of the future
on the principle of mutual union and forbearance, by
means of the cultivation of the literature which has
grown out of that spirit; and (3) to prepare the way
for a reform of education and instruction on the lines
laid down by Comenius. In order to realize these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
objects, the society further proposes (1) the publication
of the more important writings and letters of
Comenius and his associates; (2) inquiry into the history
and dogmas of the old evangelical congregations
(Waldenses, Bohemian Brethren, Swiss Brethren,
etc.), chiefly by publishing the original sources from
their history; and (3) the collection of books, manuscripts,
and documents which are important for the
history of the above objects.</p>

<p>The membership of the society, while overwhelmingly
German, includes a considerable number from
Austria-Hungary, Holland, Great Britain, the United
States, Russia, Sweden, Norway, Italy, Switzerland,
France, Greece, Belgium, and Denmark. The society
inspired the numerous celebrations in commemoration
of the three hundredth anniversary of the birth of
Comenius (March 28, 1892). These celebrations, held
at most of the educational centres in the Old World,
and at a number of places in the New, revived the
memory of Comenius, and brought his teachings to
thousands of teachers who had known him before
only as a name.</p>

<p>The society began in 1892 the publication of a high-grade
review,—<i>Monatshefte der Comenius-Gesellschaft</i>,—which
is published bi-monthly at Berlin, and is
edited by the distinguished Comenius scholar, Dr.
Ludwig Keller. This review has most creditably
carried out the purposes of the society in publishing
a wealth of original material on Comenius and his contemporaries,
that hitherto has been altogether inaccessible
to the student of the history of education. The
society also publishes a bi-monthly educational journal
for the use of teachers in the elementary schools of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
Germany especially interested in the doctrines of
Comenius. It is entitled <i>Comenius-Blätter für Völkserziehung</i>,
and is also published at Berlin and edited
by Dr. Keller. The propaganda of the Comenius
Society has done much to restore this worthy to the
place he so justly merits—the foremost educational
reformer of modern times.</p>

<p>These are some of the agencies employed by the
Comenius Society in opening up an appreciation of
this great man, who, “born in Moravia, working
amongst Czechs, Germans, English, Dutch, Swedes,
and Hungarians, with friends in France and Italy, has
won by his thought, as well as by his life, a universal
significance. As philosopher and divine, in union
with Andreæ, Dury, Milton, and others, he devoted his
life to a work of peace. He placed the weal of man,
as he termed it, above the respect for languages,
persons, and sects; thus his energies were directed
toward restraining the wrangling people, churches,
and classes from the violent utterance of their differences,
and leading them on the ground of early Christian
views to mutual peace and forbearance. As
educationalist, inspired by Bacon, he successfully
asserted the claims of experimental science in the
elementary schools of his time, placed the mother-tongue
on the list of subjects of instruction, and
included in the conception of the school the idea of
physical culture. By his demand for education of all
children, including girls, who till then had been
neglected, he became one of the fathers of modern
elementary education.”</p>

<h3>II. SELECT BIBLIOGRAPHY</h3>

<h4>(a) <i>Writings of Comenius</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p>1. <i>The great didactic.</i> Translated with introductions, biographical
and historical, by M. W. Keatinge. London:
Adam and Charles Black. 1896. pp. 468.</p>


<p>This first complete translation of Comenius’ most
philosophic work is admirably done. The biographical
introduction is given ninety-eight pages, and the historical
introduction fifty pages. These are both interesting
and critical. The book unfortunately is not
indexed.</p>


<p>2. <i>The school of infancy: an essay on the education of youth
during the first six years.</i> Edited with an introduction
and notes by Will S. Monroe. Boston: D. C. Heath &amp; Co.
1896. London: Isbister &amp; Co. 1897. pp. xvi + 99.</p>


<p>There are numerous foot-notes, intended to show the
origin of Comenius’ educational ideals and the influence
of his writings on later educators. Collateral reading
references are given at the end of each chapter, and in
the appendix there is a reasonably complete bibliography
of Comenius literature.</p>


<p>3. <i>The orbis pictus.</i> Translated into English by Charles
Hoole. London: John and Benj. Sprint, 1728. Syracuse,
N.Y.: C. W. Bardeen. 1887. pp. 100.</p>


<p>This is a very satisfactory reproduction of the famous
Hoole translation by the photographic process. Some of
the cuts are indistinct, but Mr. Bardeen wisely refrained
from retouching them, preferring occasional indistinctness
to modern tampering with the originals.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span></p>

<p>4. <i>John Amos Comenius: his life and educational work.</i> By
S. S. Laurie. Boston: Willard Small. 1885. pp. 229.</p>


<p>The introduction (pp. 1–16) gives the effect of the Renaissance
on education; a brief but appreciative sketch
of the life of Comenius follows (pp. 17–64); and the
remainder of the book is given to an exposition of his
writings.</p>


<p>5. <i>Grosse Unterrichtslehre.</i> Aus dem Lateinischen übersetzt
mit Einleitungen und Anmerkungen versehen von Julius
Beeger und Franz Zoubek. Leipzig: Siegismund und
Volkening. No date. pp. clxxvii + 280.</p>


<p>The sketch of the life of Comenius (176 pp.) is by
Zoubek, and the translation of the <i>Great didactic</i> from
the Latin into German by Beeger.</p>


<p>6. <i>Ausgewählte Schriften.</i> Aus dem Lateinischen übersetzt
und mit Einleitung und Anmerkungen versehen von
Julius Beeger und J. Leutbecher. Leipzig: Siegismund
und Volkening. No date. pp. xvi + 359.</p>


<p>A collection of the miscellaneous educational writings
of Comenius, including the <i>School of infancy</i>, <i>Panegersia</i>,
and fragments of the <i>Pansophy</i>.</p>


<p>7. <i>Grosse Unterrichtslehre.</i> Mit einer Einleitung: J. Comenius,
sein Leben und Wirken. Einleitung, Übersetzung
und Commentar von Gustav Adolph Lindner. Wien
und Leipzig: A. Pichler’s Witwe und Sohn. 1892. pp.
lxxxix + 311.</p>


<p>Perhaps the best German edition of the <i>Great didactic</i>.
The biographical sketch is less valuable than the one in
the edition by Beeger and Zoubek; but the annotations
on the <i>Great didactic</i>, covering about forty pages, give it
special pedagogic value.</p>


<p>8. <i>Ueber “Eins ist noth” (“Unum necessarium”).</i> Von
Joh. Amos Comenius. Znaim: Fournier und Haberler.
1892. pp. 22.</p>


<p>A convenient edition of Comenius’ pathetic swan song,
“The one thing needful.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span></p>

<h4>(b) <i>Biographical and Critical</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p>1. <i>Educational Review.</i> Nicholas Murray Butler, editor. New
York: Educational Review Publishing Co. March, 1892.
Vol. III. pp. 209–236.</p>


<p>The issue for March, 1892, is a Comenius number. It
contains a brief on Comenius by Professor Butler (pp.
209–211); “The place of Comenius in the history of
education,” by Professor Laurie (pp. 211–223); “The
text-books of Comenius,” by Mr. C. W. Bardeen (pp. 223–336);
and “The permanent influence of Comenius,” by
Professor Hanus (pp. 226–236).</p>

<p>2. <i>Proceedings of the National Educational Association for
1892.</i> pp. 703–728.</p>

<p>The department of superintendence of the National
Educational Association, in connection with the meeting
at Brooklyn, February 16–18, 1892, held exercises in
commemoration of the three-hundredth anniversary of
the birth of Comenius, with the following addresses:
“Private life and personal characteristics,” Dr. John
Max Hark (pp. 703–711); “Text-books of Comenius,”
Superintendent William H. Maxwell (pp. 712–723);
“Place of Comenius in the history of education,” Professor
Nicholas Murray Butler (pp. 723–728).</p>


<p>3. <i>Essays on educational reformers.</i> By Robert Hebert Quick.
New York: D. Appleton &amp; Co., 1893. pp. 119–171.</p>


<p>One of the best brief critical surveys of the writings
of Comenius and written in the fascinating style of the
genial Quick.</p>


<p>4. <i>History of pedagogy.</i> By Gabriel Compayré. Translated
by W. H. Payne. Boston: D. C. Heath &amp; Co. 1886.
pp. 122–136.</p>


<p>A brief summary of Comenius’ most important contributions
to primary instruction.</p>


<p>5. <i>The educational ideal: an outline of its growth in modern
times.</i> By James Phinney Munroe. Boston: D. C. Heath
&amp; Co. 1895. pp. 68–94.</p>


<p>A concise and critical survey of the reforms of Comenius
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>and the other realists. After Quick, the best brief survey
of the modern movement; and at many points it supplements
Quick.</p>

<p>6. <i>Barnard’s American Journal of Education.</i> Published at
Hartford by the editor, Henry Barnard. June, 1858.
Vol. V. pp. 257–298.</p>

<p>Dr. Barnard was one of the earliest to call attention to
the pedagogic value of Comenius’ writings. This translation
from Karl von Raumer’s <i>Geschichte der Pädagogik</i>
was, up to the time Professor Laurie’s book appeared,
the only comprehensive study of Comenius in English.
Raumer, however, is not an impartial critic of the realists.</p>

<p>7. <i>The history of the unitas fratrum.</i> By Edmund de Schweinitz.
Bethlehem, Penn.: Moravian Publication Office.
1885. pp. 693.</p>

<p>An authoritative account of the Moravian Brethren and
of Comenius’ relation to the same.</p>

<p>8. <i>Monatshefte der Comenius-Gesellschaft.</i> Ludwig Kellar,
editor. Berlin: Hermann Heyfelder. 1892–1900. 10
volumes.</p>

<p>A high grade bi-monthly review published by the
Comenius Society in the interest of education generally,
and in particular of the views held by the Moravian reformer.
The review is a mine of rich material on Comenius
and his contempories.</p>

<p>9. <i>Leben und Schicksale des Johann Amos Comenius.</i> Von
Anton Vrbka. Znaim: Fournier und Haberler. 1892.
pp. 160.</p>

<p>The best <i>brief</i> German life of Comenius. It is accurate
and sympathetic, and contains 17 wood-cuts.</p>

<p>10. <i>Über des Johann Amos Comenius Leben und Wirksamkeit.</i>
Von Anton Gindely. Znaim: Fournier und Haberler.
1893. pp. 109.</p>

<p>Another brief German work. Professor Gindely is a
Roman Catholic, and while he writes of Comenius with
less enthusiasm, he presents his life with critical fairness.</p>

<p>11. <i>Johann Amos Comenius: sein Leben und seine Schriften.</i>
Von Johann Kvacsala. Berlin: Julius Klinkhardt. 1892.
pp. 480 + 89.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span></p>
<p>This, so far as I know, is the most comprehensive life
of Comenius to be found in any language; but at many
points it is unnecessarily tedious and diffuse.</p>

<p>12. <i>Rein’s Encyclopädisches Handbuch der Pädagogik.</i> Langensalza:
Hermann Beyer und Söhne. Vol. I. pp.
558–569.</p>

<p>An excellent brief article by A. Nebe. An article on
the Comenius-Stiftung follows (pp. 569–573).</p>


<p>13. <i>Der Anschauungsunterricht in der deutschen Schule von
Amos Comenius bis zur Gegenwart.</i> Von Gottlieb Gustav
Deussing. Frankenberg: C. C. Rossberg. 1884.
pp. 66.</p>


<p>A historical and critical dissertation on the growth of
object teaching and nature study.</p>


<p>14. <i>Die pädagogischen Grundgedanken des Amos Comenius.</i>
Von Hermann Gottsched. Magdeburg: A. und R. Faber.
1879. pp. 64.</p>

<p>A dissertation on Comenius’ philosophy of education.</p>

<p>15. <i>Comenius: ein Systematiker in der Pädagogik.</i> Von
Walter Müller. Dresden: Bleyl und Kaemmer. 1887.
pp. 50.</p>

<p>A dissertation on the contributions of Comenius to
systematic pedagogy and school systems.</p>

<p>16. <i>Die Pädagogik des Spaniers Johann Ludwig Vives und
sein Einfluss auf Joh. Amos Comenius.</i> Erlangen: Junge
und Sohn. 1890. pp. 69.</p>

<p>Indicates traces of the educational theories of Comenius
in the writings of Vives.</p>

<p>17. <i>Die Didaktik Basedows im Vergleiche zur Didaktik des
Comenius.</i> Von Petru Garbovicianu. Bucharest: Carol
Göbl. 1887. pp. 82.</p>

<p>The influence of the <i>Great didactic</i> of Comenius on
Basedow and his institution is pointed out.</p>

<p>18. <i>Schmidt’s Encyclopädie des gesammten Erziehungs und
Unterrichtswesen.</i> Gotha: Besser. 1876. Vol. I. pp.
941–951.</p>

<p>The article is by G. Baur. It is less comprehensive,
although more sympathetic, than the article in Raumer’s
<i>Geschichte der Pädagogik</i>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span></p>
<p>19. <i>Buisson’s Dictionnaire de pédagogie et d’instruction primaire.</i>
Paris: Hanchette et Cie. 1887. Vol I. Part I.
pp. 421–427.</p>

<p>Three brief but discriminating articles. The first, on
the life of Comenius, by C. Progler (pp. 421–423); the
second, on the pedagogical writings of Comenius, by Ferdinand
Buisson (pp. 423–426); the third, on the permanent
influences of Comenius, by A. Daguet (pp. 426–427).</p></blockquote>
